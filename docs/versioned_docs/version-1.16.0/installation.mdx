# Installation

## Adding a library to the project

Install the `react-native-keyboard-controller` package in your React Native project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN" default>

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

:::warning Mandatory `react-native-reanimated` dependency

This library requires `react-native-reanimated` to work properly. If you don't have it in your project, you need to follow [installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#installation) and install it in your project before using this library.
:::

### Linking

This package supports [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

:::tip Pods update

Don't forget to re-install `pods` after adding the package and don't forget to re-assemble `android` and `ios` applications, since this library contains native code.

:::

### Expo

This library has native code, so it does not work with _Expo Go_ but you can easily install it using a [custom dev client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/).

## Adding provider

In order to use it you'll need to wrap your app with `KeyboardProvider` component.

:::info Why it's needed?

If you are bothered why it's needed, you can read more about it in [architecture](./recipes/platform-differences.md) deep dive to understand all aspects of how this library works.

:::

```tsx
import { KeyboardProvider } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <KeyboardProvider>
      {/* your main application code goes here */}
    </KeyboardProvider>
  );
}
```
