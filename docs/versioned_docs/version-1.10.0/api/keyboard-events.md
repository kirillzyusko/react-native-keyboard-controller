# KeyboardEvents

This library exposes 4 events which are available on all platforms:

- keyboardWillShow
- keyboardWillHide
- keyboardDidShow
- keyboardDidHide

## Event structure

All events have following properties:

```ts
type KeyboardEventData = {
  height: number; // height of the keyboard
  duration: number; // duration of the animation
  timestamp: number; // timestamp of the event from native thread
  target: number; // tag of the focused TextInput
};
```

## Example

```ts
import { KeyboardEvents } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

useEffect(() => {
  const show = KeyboardEvents.addListener("keyboardWillShow", (e) => {
    // place your code here
  });

  return () => {
    show.remove();
  };
}, []);
```
