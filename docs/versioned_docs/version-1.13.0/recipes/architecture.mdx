# Architecture

This library requires to wrap an app with `KeyboardProvider` component. It's needed because it stores animated values in `context`.

## Process overview

Library exposes `KeyboardControllerView` with `onKeyboardMove` method. This method is fired when keyboard frame is changed. `KeyboardProvider` automatically maps these events to `Animated.Value` and `Reanimated.SharedValue` and stores it in `context`.

:::info
Under the hood `KeyboardControllerView` is a simple `View` with one additional `onKeyboardMove` callback method, so it inherits all props from plain `View`, such as `style`, etc.
:::

Thus we have a single source of truth about keyboard position. Since values are stored in `context` we can use it in any component where we need them. Moreover, we can consume `context` values in class components as well as in hooks.

## Design principles

The library was designed to use a `context` as a global store for animated values and have a single `Provider` across the app. As of now it may be not very obvious, why it was needed to have a single source of data flow, but in future it may significantly simplify the process of the integration new features.

## Why custom `KeyboardControllerView` is needed?

Initially I had a choice which approach to use in order to send events about keyboard frames: `EventEmitters` vs `View` with callbacks. I decided to use `View` with callbacks because of several reasons:

- `react-native` core team uses similar approach for `onScroll` event from `ScrollView` component (also I knew, that it's possible to map events from such callbacks to `Animated.Value` and thus reduce bridge usage);
- to track keyboard frames on Android we need to enter to [edge-to-edge](https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/edge-to-edge) mode and it changes view paddings. Since it's managed through `View` it's easier to change padding of this view.
- `reanimated` allows to intercept `view` events using theirs `useEvent` hook and move the event handling into worklet runtime. Thus sending events via `view` allows to make an integration with `reanimated` package and handle events/animate everything directly on the UI thread.

## What is the difference between `useAnimatedKeyboard` from `react-native-reanimated` and this library?

`react-native-keyboard-controller` uses its own implementation for keyboard handling and leverages `react-native-reanimated` solely for performing UI thread updates using `SharedValue` (the library doesn't simply re-export `useAnimatedKeyboard` hook in any kind of form).

While both `useAnimatedKeyboard` from `react-native-reanimated` and this library aims to provide the same functionality, there are some differences between them. Below you can find a comparison of the two libraries:

To sum it up:

- if you are using `useAnimatedKeyboard` and you are satisfied with it, then there is no sense to switch to `react-native-keyboard-controller`;

- if you are planning to add advanced keyboard handling into large existing project, then `react-native-keyboard-controller` can be a better choice, since it has drop-in replacement components (`KeyboardAvoidingView`, `KeyboardAwareScrollView`, etc.), you can toggle the functionality dynamically on per screen basic, you can dynamically change `softInputMode` which should simplify the integration process.
