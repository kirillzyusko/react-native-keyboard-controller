# KeyboardBackgroundView

import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import lottie from "./keyboard-background-view.lottie.json";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: 20 }}>
  <Lottie
    className="lottie"
    animationData={lottie}
    style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    loop
  />
</div>

`KeyboardBackgroundView` is designed to match the background color of the keyboard. Using this low-level component you can design various keyboard extensions, implement "shared transitions" (Safari/Photos app search) and more.

:::info `KeyboardProvider` presence
This component works independently of `KeyboardProvider`. If you're only using this component from the library, wrapping your entire app in `KeyboardProvider` is not required.
:::

:::warning
This component works well in most cases. However, since keyboard apps can customize their background color and there's no direct API to retrieve it, the background may not perfectly match in some situations.

## Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { TextInput, View } from "react-native";
import {
  KeyboardBackgroundView,
  KeyboardStickyView,
  useReanimatedKeyboardAnimation,
} from "react-native-keyboard-controller";
import Reanimated, {
  interpolateColor,
  useAnimatedStyle,
} from "react-native-reanimated";
import {
  SafeAreaView,
  useSafeAreaInsets,
} from "react-native-safe-area-context";

const ReanimatedBackgroundView = Reanimated.createAnimatedComponent(
  KeyboardBackgroundView,
);
const ReanimatedTextInput = Reanimated.createAnimatedComponent(TextInput);

const KeyboardSharedTransitionExample = () => {
  const { bottom } = useSafeAreaInsets();
  const { progress } = useReanimatedKeyboardAnimation();

  const opacity = useAnimatedStyle(
    () => ({
      height: 291 + 70,
      opacity: progress.value,
    }),
    [],
  );
  const inputColor = useAnimatedStyle(
    () => ({
      backgroundColor: interpolateColor(
        progress.value,
        [0, 1],
        ["#323232", "#474747"],
      ),
    }),
    [],
  );

  return (
    <SafeAreaView
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "#000000",
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "flex-end",
      }}
    >
      <KeyboardStickyView offset={{ closed: 291, opened: 291 + bottom }}>
        <ReanimatedBackgroundView style={opacity} />
        <View
          style={{
            marginHorizontal: 30,
            marginVertical: 16,
            position: "absolute",
            left: 0,
            right: 0,
            bottom: 0,
            top: 0,
          }}
        >
          <ReanimatedTextInput
            placeholder="127.0.0.1"
            placeholderTextColor="#ecececec"
            style={[
              {
                width: "100%",
                padding: 10,
                borderRadius: 8,
                textAlign: "center",
              },
              inputColor,
            ]}
          />
        </View>
      </KeyboardStickyView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

export default KeyboardSharedTransitionExample;
```
