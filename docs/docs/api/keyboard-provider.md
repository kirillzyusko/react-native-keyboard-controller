# KeyboardProvider

`KeyboardProvider` should wrap your app. Under the hood it works with `KeyboardControllerView` to receive events during keyboard movements, maps these events to `Animated`/`Reanimated` values and store them in `context`.

## Props

### `statusBarTranslucent` <div className="label android"></div>

A boolean prop to indicate whether `StatusBar` should be translucent on `Android` or not.

:::caution Important defaults
By default this library stretches to full screen (`edge-to-edge` mode) and status bar becomes translucent. But the library tries to use standard RN app behavior and automatically applies padding from top to look like a standard RN app. If you use `translucent` prop for `StatusBar` component - it will not work anymore. You'll need to specify it on provider level. For more info [see](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/30) this PR.

### `navigationBarTranslucent` <div className="label android"></div>

A boolean prop to indicate whether [NavigationBar](https://m2.material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-bars.html#android-navigation-bar) should be translucent on `Android` or not.

### `preserveEdgeToEdge` <div className="label android"></div>

A boolean property indicating whether to keep [edge-to-edge](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge) mode always enabled (even when you disable the module). This is useful if you are using an external library to enable it and don't want this library to disable it.

:::info Good to know
If you use [react-native-edge-to-edge](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-edge-to-edge), then `statusBarTranslucent`, `navigationBarTranslucent` and `preserveEdgeToEdge` are automatically set to `true`, so you don't need to worry about them.

### `enabled`

A boolean prop indicating whether the module is enabled. It indicate only initial state, i. e. if you try to change this prop after component mount it will not have any effect. To change the property in runtime use [useKeyboardController](./hooks/module/use-keyboard-controller.md) hook and `setEnabled` method. Defaults to `true`.

Could be useful to set it to `false` if you want to activate the module only on specific screens.

## Example

```tsx
import { KeyboardProvider } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <KeyboardProvider>
      {/* The other components in your tree */}
    </KeyboardProvider>
  );
};
```
