# KeyboardAvoidingView

This component will automatically adjust its height, position, or bottom padding based on the keyboard height to remain visible while the virtual keyboard is displayed.

## Why another `KeyboardAvoidingView` is needed?

This new `KeyboardAvoidingView` maintains the familiar React Native [API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview) but ensures consistent behavior and animations on both `iOS` and `Android` platforms. Unlike the existing solution, which primarily caters to `iOS`, this component eliminates platform discrepancies, providing a unified user experience. By reproducing the same animations and behaviors on both platforms, it simplifies cross-platform development, meets user expectations for consistency, and enhances code maintainability. Ultimately, it addresses the need for a reliable and uniform keyboard interaction solution across different devices.

Below is a visual difference between the implementations (the animation is _**4x**_ times slower for better visual perception).

## Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  Text,
  TextInput,
  TouchableOpacity,
  View,
  StyleSheet,
} from "react-native";
import { KeyboardAvoidingView } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

export default function KeyboardAvoidingViewExample() {
  return (
    <KeyboardAvoidingView
      behavior={"padding"}
      keyboardVerticalOffset={100}
      style={styles.content}
    >
      <View style={styles.inner}>
        <Text style={styles.heading}>Header</Text>
        <View>
          <TextInput placeholder="Username" style={styles.textInput} />

          <Text style={styles.text}>Submit</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  content: {
    flex: 1,
    maxHeight: 600,
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 36,
    marginBottom: 48,
    fontWeight: "600",

    justifyContent: "space-between",
  },
  textInput: {
    height: 45,

    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 10,
    marginBottom: 36,
    paddingLeft: 10,
  },
  button: {
    marginTop: 12,
    height: 45,
    borderRadius: 10,
    backgroundColor: "rgb(40, 64, 147)",
    justifyContent: "center",
