New 1.4.0 release enhance API and adds new `useKeyboardHandler` hook. While keeping no breaking changes this release (via new hook) adds an ability to have intermediate values on iOS for `height` and `progress` values (before it was not possible and it was a restriction of the library).

Also this hooks allow to track keyboard lifecycle and it's better suit for complex animations ðŸ˜Ž

Check out the new documentation for this hook, upgrade library version to `1.4.0` and start using it today!
