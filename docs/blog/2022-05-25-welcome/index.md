If you have ever worked with keyboard in react-native, you will probably have noticed that it is a little bit pain.

Already exists tens of libraries called to solve a particular problem and all of them are trying to solve it in a different way. Though, if we can try to have a look from a different angle we can clearly understand a simple rule - if we could have an access to animated movement, then we could do much more and better, than current libraries allow us to do and moreover it will be more smooth.
