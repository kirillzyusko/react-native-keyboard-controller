## Key features

### `useFocusedInputHandler` hook

Introducing the `useFocusedInputHandler` hook! This powerful addition empowers developers to manage focused input with unparalleled ease. The hook comes with a straightforward signature:

```ts
useFocusedInputHandler({
  onChangeText: ({ text }) => {
    'worklet';
    
    // Your custom logic here
  }
}, []);
```

Whenever you are building your own avoiding solution or tracking user activity this hook can be a perfect fit for your needs!

### Exporting `KeyboardAwareScrollView`

I've heard your feedback, and in response, I'm now exporting `KeyboardAwareScrollView` from the library core. This widely-used component provides an enhanced `ScrollView` experience, ensuring smoother navigation and improved user interactions. Now, you can effortlessly integrate it into your projects and leverage its capabilities for a more polished UI üòé

### `KeyboardController.dismiss()` method

Simplify your workflow with the addition of the `KeyboardController.dismiss()` method. This method streamlines the dismissal of the keyboard, making it a breeze to manage user input interactions. Enhance the user experience by effortlessly controlling when and how the keyboard should disappear.

As we bid farewell to 2023, it's a moment to reflect on the incredible strides we've made together. This year has been marked by innovation, user-centric enhancements, and the continuous evolution of our toolkit. Here's a summary of the key milestones:

### Interactive Keyboard Implementation

I took a giant leap forward by implementing an interactive keyboard. This feature enhances user engagement and provides a dynamic interface for a more immersive experience. Now, user interactions with the keyboard are not just functional but also interactive and enjoyable üòä

### Expanded Event Metadata

In response to your needs, I introduced new metadata fields ‚Äî `duration`, `target` and `timestamp` ‚Äî to events. These additions provide more comprehensive insights into user interactions, enabling you to fine-tune and optimize your applications with a deeper understanding of user behavior.

### Diverse Component Additions

My commitment to versatility led to the incorporation of several new components. The introduction of `KeyboardAvoidingView`, `KeyboardStickyFooter`, and `KeyboardAwareScrollView` opens up a world of possibilities for crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces. These components are designed to seamlessly integrate into your projects, offering enhanced UI control.

### Empowering Hooks

Empowering developers with more tools, I introduced a series of new hooks. From the versatile `useKeyboardController` to the focused input management provided by `useReanimatedFocusedInput` and the feature-rich `useFocusedInputHandler` hook, these additions streamline development and elevate the capabilities of your React Native applications.
