I'm glad to announce that upcoming release finally exposes pre-built components for handling keyboard insets. In this release I've added only one well-known `KeyboardAvoidingView`, but later I'll add more components, such as `KeyboardAwareScrollView`, `StickyFooter` etc.

import KeyboardAvoidingViewComparison from '../../src/components/KeyboardAvoidingViewComparison';

<KeyboardAvoidingViewComparison />
