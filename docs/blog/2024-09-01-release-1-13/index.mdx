I'm excited to announce the latest release, version `1.13.0`, of `react-native-keyboard-controller`!

<!-- truncate -->

## `Modal` support on Android

Starting from the very first version of this library it was impossible to use the functionality of this library inside the `Modal`. It was caused by next factors:

- the `Modal` window lives in its own view hierarchy;
- `react-native` set `adjustResize` mode to `window` of the `Modal`.

As a result whenever you tru to use `react-native-keyboard-controller` inside the `Modal` you will get a default behavior (but sometimes even mixed behaviors, i. e. hooks will report keyboard height and `Modal` content will be automatically resized).

As a temporary workaround people were using a workaround with module disabling:

```tsx
import { useKeyboardController } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

// ... somewhere in your modal screen ...

const { enabled, setEnabled } = useKeyboardController();

useEffect(() => {
  setEnabled(false);
}, []);
```

To fallback to a fully default behavior. While it was working approach it still had some downsides, such as inconsistent keyboard handling/animations across the app.

With the new release it's not a problem anymore - now you can use all hooks and components inside the `Modal` without additional hustle and it will just work out of the box.

## Support for `StatusBar.translucent`

The `StatusBar` integration was always a problematic because `react-native` uses deprecated methods that eventually breaks keyboard events. This module exports its own `StatusBarManagerCompat` module and uses this module automatically to handle `StatusBar` changes.

The problem was in the fact that `StatusBarManagerCompat` module didn't react on `translucent` prop changes. Now it's not the case and you can disable/enable `translucent` property dynamically.

:::info
You may think that `statusBarTranslucent` prop on `KeyboardProvider` is not needed anymore, but I would recommend to keep it - it'll help to layout `KeyboardProvider` properly in one frame without frame jumps.

## New `offset` prop for `KeyboardGestureArea`

Starting from this release I'm adding more customization to interactive keyboard handling. Now on `Android` you can add `offset` property (which can be equal to your `TextInput` height) to your `KeyboardGestureArea` component - it'll allow you to extend the keyboard area and start dismiss gesture starting from the `TextInput` top border and not from the keyboard itself.

## `react-native@0.75` support

## What's next?
