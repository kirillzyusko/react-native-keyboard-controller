# KeyboardBackgroundView

<!-- -->

`KeyboardBackgroundView` is a visual-only utility that replicates the background of the system keyboard. It doesn't alter layout or position itself beneath the keyboard — it simply renders a view that seamlessly matches the keyboard’s appearance. By matching this color you can create the illusion that your UI and the keyboard share a single, continuous surface.

Primary Use Case

Use this component when you need your UI elements to appear visually connected to the keyboard - perfect for toolbars, input accessories, or panels that should feel like natural keyboard extensions.

## Key Features[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/pr-preview/pr-1420/docs/api/views/keyboard-background-view.md#key-features "Direct link to Key Features")

* 🎨 **Background Color Matching**: Automatically aligns with system keyboard colors
* 🖌️ **Visual Continuity**: Creates illusion of shared surfaces during transitions
* ⚡ **Independent Operation**: Functions without requiring a KeyboardProvider

## When to Use[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/pr-preview/pr-1420/docs/api/views/keyboard-background-view.md#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")

Use `KeyboardBackgroundView` when:

* You want to **visually align your UI** with the keyboard’s background.
* You’re implementing **shared element transitions** tied to keyboard state.
* You need **a smooth visual bridge** between your layout and the system keyboard without interfering with keyboard positioning or layout logic.
* You create **shared visual spaces**, ideal for scenarios like search inputs or context-sensitive panels that smoothly connect with keyboard appearance.
* You **visually blend** your UI with the keyboard’s look.

warning

While this component works well in most scenarios, keyboard apps allow users to customize their background color. Since Android/iOS do not expose keyboard background APIs, an exact match isn't always guaranteed.

## Props[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/pr-preview/pr-1420/docs/api/views/keyboard-background-view.md#props "Direct link to Props")

`KeyboardBackgroundView` forwards all [`View`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props) props, so you can treat it like any standard React Native view.
