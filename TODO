# ToDo list

- [x] keyboardVerticalOffset
- [x] make UI in example project better :)
- [x] table with lottie is not resizing when screen dimensions were changed - make it responsive

- [ ] check how keyboard handle size changes
== [ ] Android jumpy behavior - should interpolate based on `height` and interpolate from `initialKeyboardFrame` to `finalKeyboardFrame`

- [ ] should work on both platforms in the same way as RN implementation
== [-] iOS works almost as RN (except the case, when we set content as flex: 1 - for header + text inputs and flex: 1 - for button -> in this case inputs are animating only through the half of the movement (because view is not resizing anymore))
== [ ] android layout jump, when your keyboard was shown/hidden and then you switch to RN impl

- [ ] import 'react-native-keyboard-controller/components';
- [x] make KeyboardAvoidingView folder and place different files there -> hooks, constants, KeyboardAvoidingView, etc.
- [ ] useSmoothKeyboardHandler instead of useKeyboardHandler
- [ ] port example to Fabric
- [ ] update initialFrameHeight when keyboard is not shown
