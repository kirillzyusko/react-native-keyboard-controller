# ToDo

- [x] skip disabled fields
- [x] fabric test
- [x] dark theme
- [x] ToolBar/Toolbar UI component
- [x] accessibility
- [x] animations
- [x] on iOS when you go from down to top - birthday inputs (2) are skipped
- [x] setFocusTo("current") -> like AutoFill contacts in iOS (hide and open keyboard)
- [x] when you press and next/prev icon gets disabled -> animation is very strange
- [x] hasNext/hasPrev (or current/total)?
- [x] e2e tests
- [x] reduce `useColorScheme() || "light";` code duplication
- [x] an ability to customize arrow/text color
- [x] memo/callbacks everywhere
- [x] js jest tests (to verify mocks)
- [x] remove code with `onLayout` + be sure we use `useMemo` in this code wherever we need it
- [x] unit tests for Android
- [x] an ability to customize text/arrow elements
- [x] customization
- [x] apply scale to arrows to check whether there is any missing pixels between two lines/incorrect overlap
- [-] set focus to custom input (date picker) - how it should be done? Test on iOS? <- we already have custom contacts input
- [-] improve accessibility (arrows should react on bold/fontSize changes) <- requires custom font
- [-] unit tests for iOS <- hard to setup in RN project since RN is not found
- [-] iOS -> background should be transparent/blurred?
- [ ] last input disabled
- [ ] more effective way for gathering all inputs on screen (now it finds a lot of duplicates)
- [ ] arrow + ripple effect - incorrect positioning
- [ ] customize a11y labels and hints

Major problems (for opening PR):

- (x) setFocusTo("current")
- (x) disable/enable buttons (how to propagate events/ animated transitions)
- (x) e2e tests
- (x) disable/enable buttons on Android
- (x) handle setFocusTo("next") when we select a contact (iOS)
- (x) write last e2e tests (interaction with AutoFill contacts, conditional rendering)
- (x) on Android buttons disabling/enabling looks tooo slow - test on a real device + capture performance benchmarks (how much time it takes to go from JS -> native -> JS)
- (x) enhanced example app
- (x) port example to fabric
