- (x) close after interactive gesture - sudden jump of 75 pixels -> fixed by detaching iav during `onInteractive`
- (x) keyboard hidden -> remove inputAccessoryView - done in resignFirstResponder
- show after interactive - keyboard height is 386
- iOS 16 - after attaching fake iav we dispatch onEnd with height - 248 (298 - 50)
