# TODO (bug tracker)

- [x] - onInteractive?
- [x] - how to handle onStart/onEnd during interactive dismissing? (will be called in the start/end of programmatic animation, when user drags keyboard we will fire `onInteractive`)
- [ ] - linear animation behavior correct?
- [ ] - documentation
- [ ] - iOS implementation
- [x] - swipe frequently up/down and app becomes to consume a lot of CPU resources (because of inverted `ScrollView` - used `180deg` instead of `scaleY: -1`)
- [ ] - replicate fix with `180deg` instead of `scaleY: -1` for all other code pieces
