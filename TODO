- (x) close after interactive gesture - sudden jump of 75 pixels -> fixed by detaching iav during `onInteractive`
- (x) keyboard hidden -> remove inputAccessoryView - done in resignFirstResponder
- (x) iOS 16 - after attaching fake iav we dispatch onEnd with height - 248 (298 - 50) -> ignore events after attaching iav, because in keyboardDidAppear `position` can be a random value (291 or 341)
- (x) text input grow -> can not make interactive gesture (Optional(424.6666666666667)  424.66666666666674) - maybe because of frequent conversions to CGFloat? <- fixed via rounding
- (x) 1 show after interactive - keyboard height is 386
- (x) 2 show after interactive - iav is not attached again
- (x) 3 two events get dispatched when we remove iav in onInteractive - (dispatch `shouldIgnoreKeyboardEvents` in .hide (KEA)? - doesn't work because swizzle calls .hide when keyboard appear)
- (x) 4 two events get dispatched after 2nd onInteractive (fix with pan gesture responder - when it's active ignore plain keyboard events)
- (x) 5 TimingAnimation is unsynchronized
- (x) 6 hide interactively -> tap input many times -> keyboard is shown and composer is not moving and it looks like events are broken -> for RCTRootView we need to resign synchronously
- (x) 7 remove pan gesture responder stuff
- 8 resolve swiftlint issues
- 9 resolve various flickers (test iOS 15 - 18)
- 10 iOS 15 sometimes keyboardDidDisappear gets triggered before onKeyboardMove events (duration = 85) --> caused by constant usage of onMove?
- (x) 11 iOS 15 sometimes we resign responder too early in when dismissed with interactive and it produces several junky frames (in the end composer disappears and appears) --> caused by constant usage of onMove? --> UI fixed by removing lastOffset (progress is still NaN, fixed only for iOS 15) - the full fix is to remove EventsIgnorer in willDisappear/didDisappear callbacks, because `hide` triggers only *Appear events
- (x) 12 remove the code with lastOffset (this is not needed as we hide view only in resignFirstResponder)
- 13 test how switching between two inputs works?
- (x) 14 fix a crash when you re-enter the page - use `strong` modifier
- 15 iPhone iOS 15 - progress NaN in last onMove
- (x) 16 iPhone iOS 15 - re-enter the page and offset is not added (it's removed)

Test scenarios:
- tap and show keyboard
- tap on screen to hide a keyboard
- tap and show keyboard
- swipe down to hide a keyboard
- tap and show keyboard
- swipe down and up to show a keyboard
- change focus to new input - be sure offset is not added
- change focus to input with offset - be sure offset attached again

::  (x) call actual code for hide only once
::: (x) dispatch ignore event when we actually hide iav (will fix 3)
::: (add `lastOffset`) - will fix 1 <- last time when I added it was resetting somehow, need to figure out where and why exactly
::: add code in `keyboardDidAppear` in KAE to increase/attach iav again (will fix 2)
