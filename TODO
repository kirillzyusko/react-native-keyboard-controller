# TODO (bug tracker)

- [x] - onInteractive?
- [x] - how to handle onStart/onEnd during interactive dismissing? (will be called in the start/end of programmatic animation, when user drags keyboard we will fire `onInteractive`)
- [ ] - linear animation behavior correct?
- [ ] - documentation
- [ ] - iOS implementation
- [x] - swipe frequently up/down and app becomes to consume a lot of CPU resources (because of inverted `ScrollView` - used `180deg` instead of `scaleY: -1`)
- [ ] - replicate fix with `180deg` instead of `scaleY: -1` for all other code pieces
- [ ] - implement iOS interpolator
- [ ] - if user swipes and keyboard becomes invisible - we need to send scroll events back to ScrollView
- [ ] - if you make fast swipe gesture - app behaves a little bit strange/unexpected;
- [ ] - swipe keyboard to 50% and release a finger (animation behaves strange, keyboard takes 100% of the height and then animates to the "close" state);
