- (x) iOS implementation
- (x) incorrect positioning of elements - why view can be stretched to full screen?
- (x) why justifyContent: "center" and flex: 1 doesn't work - first view must be without a style because otherwise styling is kind of conflicting with native styles
- (x) RNGH on Android - GestureHandlerRootView
- (x) Android hot reloading <- pass all events from HostView to underlying view + visible property
- (x) docs
- (x) lottie animation

### Docs

- landing page - create immersive keyboard experience: draw over and behind the keyboard to deliver best possible user experience to your application without keyboard shuttering and annoying jumps
- add to comparison to reanimated

### E2E

- e2e tests

### Bugs

- (x) handle touches on iOS <- used `RCTTouchHandler`
- (x) overlap navigationBar on Android
- (x) cleanup Android implementation (create 3 separate files)
- (x) crash on Android when you tap outside of `Touchable` area <- wrap with `TouchableWithoutFeedback`
- (-) stretch view to full screen (iOS)/ {flex: 1} - we can specify window/height manually in JS? Do we need to have a fix on Android then? (yes, otherwise nav bar may not be covered and click in this area will lead to crash)
