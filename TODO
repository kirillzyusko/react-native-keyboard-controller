# ToDo list

- [x] keyboardVerticalOffset
- [x] make UI in example project better :)

- [ ] check how keyboard handle size changes
== Android jumpy behavior - should interpolate based on `height` and interpolate from `initialKeyboardFrame` to `finalKeyboardFrame` (android layout jump, when your keyboard was shown/hidden and then you switch to RN impl)

- [ ] should work on both platforms in the same way as RN implementation
== iOS works almost as RN (except the case, when we set content as flex: 1 - for header + text inputs and flex: 1 - for button -> in this case inputs are animating only through the half of the movement (because view is not resizing anymore))

- [ ] import 'react-native-keyboard-controller/components';
