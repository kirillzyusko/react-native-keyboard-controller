# TODO (bug tracker)

- [x] - onInteractive?
- [x] - how to handle onStart/onEnd during interactive dismissing? (will be called in the start/end of programmatic animation, when user drags keyboard we will fire `onInteractive`)
- [x] - linear animation behavior correct?
- [-] - documentation <- in separate PR
- [-] - iOS implementation <- later/in separate PR
- [x] - swipe frequently up/down and app becomes to consume a lot of CPU resources (because of inverted `ScrollView` - used `180deg` instead of `scaleY: -1`)
- [x] - implement iOS interpolator (for Android)
- [x] - replicate fix with `180deg` instead of `scaleY: -1` for all other code pieces
- [x] - if you make fast swipe gesture - app behaves a little bit strange/unexpected (because of velocityY > 0 in `animateToFinish`? if user swipes down the value will be > 0, if swipes up < 0);
- [x] - `scrollImeOnScreenWhenNotVisible` (allowToShowKeyboardWhenInvisible/showKeyboardOnSwipeUpWhenInvisible/controlKeyboardOnSwipeUpWhenInvisible) and `scrollImeOffScreenWhenVisible` (controlKeyboardOnSwipeDownWhenVisible) should be configurable via react props - allowToDismiss/allowToShow::allowToShowKeyboardFromHiddenStateBySwipeUp?
- [x] - port changes to fabric architecture;
- [x] - test fabric app;
- [x] - swipe keyboard to 50% and release a finger (animation behaves strange, keyboard takes 100% of the height and then animates to the "close" state) - not reproducible on 12/03/2022;

- [ ] - if user swipes and keyboard becomes invisible - we need to send scroll events back to ScrollView (if we don't lock we don't need to carry about it)
- [ ] - `ScrollView` lock/unlock - may be not needed, twitches can be because of `fakeView`
- [ ] - linear animation should work the same as in google app example;
- [ ] - add support for opacity interpolation
- [ ] - clean up documentation by google;
- [ ] - remove println statements
