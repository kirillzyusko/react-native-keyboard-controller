- (x) port to fabric (both iOS and Android)
- (x) revert monkey patch when setEnabled(false)
- (x) native-stack breaks correct enabling/disabling <- setup insets listener on `disable`
- test react-native-integration
- maybe need to remove all listeners on disable (onApplyWindowInset on rootView)?
- test `navigationBatTranslucent` prop
- iOS props initialization mechanism (paper - set props first (initialize on mount), fabric - set props after component creation (updateProps))
