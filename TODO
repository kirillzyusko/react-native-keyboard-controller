# ToDo

- [x] skip disabled fields
- [x] fabric test
- [x] dark theme
- [x] ToolBar/Toolbar UI component
- [x] accessibility
- [x] animations
- [x] on iOS when you go from down to top - birthday inputs (2) are skipped
- [x] setFocusTo("current") -> like AutoFill contacts in iOS (hide and open keyboard)
- [x] when you press and next/prev icon gets disabled -> animation is very strange
- [x] hasNext/hasPrev (or current/total)?
- [ ] set focus to custom input (date picker) - how it should be done? Test on iOS?
- [ ] unit tests for iOS/Android
- [ ] customization
- [ ] memo/callbacks everywhere
- [ ] reduce `useColorScheme() || "light";` code duplication
- [ ] e2e tests
- [ ] improve accessibility (arrows should react on bold/fontSize changes)

Major problems (for opening PR):

- (x) setFocusTo("current")
- (x) disable/enable buttons (how to propagate events/ animated transitions)
- (x) e2e tests
- disable/enable buttons on Android
- enhanced example app
- handle setFocusTo("next") when we select a contact
