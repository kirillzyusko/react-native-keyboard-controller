# ToDo

- [x] skip disabled fields
- [x] fabric test
- [-] hasNext/hasPrev (or current/total)?
- [-] ToolBar/Toolbar UI component
- [ ] setFocusTo("current") -> like AutoFill contacts in iOS (hide and open keyboard)
- [ ] set focus to custom input (date picker) - how it should be done? Test on iOS?
- [ ] unit tests for iOS/Android
