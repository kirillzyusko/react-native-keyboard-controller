It\u2019s a **small** (only 500 lines of code added compared to the previous release), but a very **important** one - it significantly improves compatibility across the `react-native` ecosystem.\\n\\nCurious about what\u2019s new? Let\u2019s dive in!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nimport Head from \\"@docusaurus/Head\\";\\n\\n## Expo Snack support\\n\\nIn Expo SDK 54, `react-native-keyboard-controller` lib was added to the **Expo Go**, which meant you could use the library in any project powered by Expo. However, it still was not fully compatible with Expo Snacks - trying to use it there resulted in errors.\\n\\nWith version `1.20.0`, that limitation is finally gone. The library now works seamlessly in Expo Snacks as well! \ud83c\udf89 This means you can easily share code, create reproduction examples, and test everything directly in the browser. It\u2019s also a big win for the library itself - I can now rework the documentation and turn all the example code into fully interactive sandboxes.\\n\\nBelow is an embedded Snack that includes the code I used for my [AppJS Conf](https://appjs.co) demo this year:\\n\\n<div\\n  data-snack-id=\\"@kirylziusko/chat-keyboard-avoiding-view\\"\\n  data-snack-platform=\\"ios\\"\\n  data-snack-preview=\\"true\\"\\n  data-snack-theme=\\"light\\"\\n  style={{\\n    overflow: \\"hidden\\",\\n    background: \\"#fbfcfd\\",\\n    border: \\"1px solid var(--color-border)\\",\\n    borderRadius: 4,\\n    height: 505,\\n    width: \\"100%\\",\\n  }}\\n></div>\\n\\n<Head>\\n  <script src=\\"https://snack.expo.dev/embed.js\\" async />\\n</Head>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n:::info 1.13.x Flashbacks\\nTo support **Expo Snacks** I had to rewrite the mechanism that propagates events to worklet handlers. The last time I made a change like this was in the `1.13.x` release, and in the beginning of this release I\'ve received many bug reports that something wasn\'t working in various setups.\\n\\nThe new approach _shouldn\'t_ cause issues, **but** I can not guarantee that nothing will break - every React Native project is unique, and unexpected edge cases do happen. If you notice any incompatibilities between `1.19.x` and `1.20.x`, please bare with me and report a bug. I promise to address everything and ensure even wider compatibility than before!\\n:::\\n\\n## Deprecated `useAnimatedKeyboard` hook from `react-native-reanimated`\\n\\nThe `react-native-reanimated` used to provide its own hook for tracking keyboard movement: `useAnimatedKeyboard`.\\n\\nStarting from `react-native-reanimated@4.2.0`, the Reanimated team decided to stop supporting this hook and officially deprecated it and now they recommend to migrate to `react-native-keyboard-controller` instead.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve worked closely together to prepare a migration guide and ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. To help with that, I added a compatibility version of `useAnimatedKeyboard` directly into this library.\\n\\nIf you\'re migrating from `react-native-reanimated` to `react-native-keyboard-controller` and don\'t want to re-write your entire codebase right away, you can simply switch your imports to the compat layer:\\n\\n```diff\\n-import {useAnimatedKeyboard, KeyboardState} from \\"react-native-reanimated\\";\\n+import {useAnimatedKeyboard, KeyboardState} from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s all you need to do. If you encounter any bugs or issues, please report them in the `react-native-keyboard-controller` repository.\\n\\n## New `assureFocusedInputVisible` method for `KeyboardAwareScrollView`\\n\\nThe `KeyboardAwareScrollView` already tracks a lot of things - **keyboard movements**, **layout changes** of the focused input, **cursor position** updates, and more. However, in some cases the layout inside the `KeyboardAwareScrollView` can shift unexpectedly (for example, after showing validation errors), and these changes are difficult to track natively.\\n\\nPreviously, ensuring the focused input stayed visible required writing custom logic to _estimate_ how far the view should scroll. This approach came with several drawbacks:\\n\\n- you had to write and maintain quite a bit of custom code;\\n- the scroll estimation was often inaccurate, especially when users had increased font sizes or other accessibility settings enabled;\\n\\nimport ComparisonTable from \\"@site/src/components/ComparisonTable\\";\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<ComparisonTable\\n  left={<Video src=\\"/video/validation-without-scroll.mov\\" width={65} />}\\n  right={<Video src=\\"/video/validation-with-scroll.mov\\" width={65} />}\\n  leftText={<i>Focused input gets hidden after validation</i>}\\n  rightText={\\n    <i>Focused input remains visible after validation and gets auto-scrolled</i>\\n  }\\n/>\\n\\nStarting from `react-native-keyboard-controller@1.20.0`, there\u2019s now a built-in solution: a new method on `KeyboardAwareScrollView` called `assureFocusedInputVisible`.\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport {\\n  KeyboardAwareScrollView,\\n  KeyboardAwareScrollViewRef,\\n} from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nfunction LongForm() {\\n  const ref = useRef<KeyboardAwareScrollViewRef>(null);\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    ref.current?.assureFocusedInputVisible();\\n  }, [errors]);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <KeyboardAwareScrollView ref={ref} bottomOffset={50}>\\n      {/*...*/}\\n    </KeyboardAwareScrollView>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith this method, you can ensure that the focused input always remains visible \u2014 even after layout changes \u2014 with **pixel-perfect accuracy across all configurations**, including when accessibility settings like larger fonts are enabled.\\n\\n## Achieved milestones\\n\\nI expect this to be the last **minor** release of the year (though I\u2019ll continue shipping **patch** releases), so it feels like the right moment to look back at what we\u2019ve all accomplished together. With 2026 around the corner, here\u2019s a small retrospective \u2014 similar to the one I did [back in 2023](./new-features-achieved-milestones#achieved-milestones).\\n\\n### \ud83d\udce6 5 releases per year\\n\\nWe\u2019re moving at a fast pace: just like in previous years, we shipped **over five releases** in 2025 \u2014 each one bringing new features, improvements, and community-requested enhancements.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f 3100 stars on GitHub\\n\\nIn just two years, the library gained **2000+ new GitHub stars**. That number still blows my mind. Two years ago we crossed the **1000-star** mark \u2014 something that already felt surreal \u2014 and now we\u2019re at **3100+**.\\n\\nThank you to every developer who uses the library, reports issues, contributes ideas, or simply stars the repo. It truly means a lot \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcc8 450k weekly downloads on npm\\n\\nTwo years ago, the library had around **8,000 weekly downloads**. Today, it\u2019s at **450,000+** \u2014 a **56\xd7 growth** in just **24 months**.\\n\\nThis incredible adoption is a clear sign of how essential smooth keyboard handling is in the React Native ecosystem.\\n\\n### \ud83e\udd1d Impact on open source community\\n\\n`react-native-keyboard-controller` is now widely used across the ecosystem - from individual developers to large-scale production apps. Some well-known adopters include:\\n\\n- **Bluesky** - powering polished keyboard interactions in a high-traffic social app\\n- **Expensify** - used in a massive cross-platform codebase with millions of users\\n- **V0 (Vercel)** - helping elevate UX in modern React Native experiences\\n\\nSeeing the library become part of the toolchain for such impactful products is incredibly motivating \u2014 and a reminder of why maintaining open source is worth the effort.\\n\\n### \u2764\ufe0f Sponsors support\\n\\nI want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to all the sponsors who support this project. Your contributions genuinely make a difference - without you, it simply wouldn\u2019t be possible to maintain the library at this level of quality, release new features, fix issues quickly, and keep pushing the ecosystem forward.\\n\\nOpen source takes time, energy, and consistency, and your support is what makes that effort sustainable. Thank you for believing in the project, for investing in its future, and for helping thousands of developers build better products every day. \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\nA huge thank you to all my sponsors: [Hirbod](https://github.com/hirbod), [MarceloPrado](https://github.com/MarceloPrado), [mrtawil](https://github.com/mrtawil), [ksugaevskaya](https://github.com/ksugaevskaya).

This release brings:\\n\\n- A brand new **compound KeyboardToolbar API**\\n- The ability to **dismiss the keyboard instantly** (without animation!)\\n- Full **React Native 0.80+** compatibility\\n- And smaller fixes and refinements \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive into what\u2019s new \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd25 New `KeyboardToolbar` API\\n\\nWhen the `KeyboardToolbar` API first landed in `1.11.0`, it unlocked powerful customization options \u2014 but it also came with a long list of props that made configuration a bit... verbose.\\n\\nWith **release 1.19**, the API has been redesigned from the ground up to make it **more flexible, modular, and expressive** - without sacrificing any of that power.\\n\\nIntroducing the new compound component pattern:\\n\\n```tsx\\n<KeyboardToolbar opacity={Platform.OS === \\"ios\\" ? \\"4F\\" : \\"DD\\"}>\\n  <KeyboardToolbar.Background>\\n    <BlurView\\n      blurAmount={32}\\n      blurType={Platform.OS === \\"ios\\" ? \\"chromeMaterial\\" : \\"light\\"}\\n      reducedTransparencyFallbackColor=\\"white\\"\\n      style={styles.absolute}\\n    />\\n  </KeyboardToolbar.Background>\\n  <KeyboardToolbar.Content>\\n    {showAutoFill ? (\\n      <AutoFillContacts onContactSelected={onContactSelected} />\\n    ) : null}\\n  </KeyboardToolbar.Content>\\n  <KeyboardToolbar.Prev onPress={haptic} />\\n  <KeyboardToolbar.Next onPress={haptic} />\\n  <KeyboardToolbar.Done onPress={haptic} />\\n</KeyboardToolbar>\\n```\\n\\nThis approach makes the toolbar **composable** (choose which parts to render), **customizable** (easily swap or style individual sections) and **readable** (your code now mirrors the actual UI layout).\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve ever wished for more control or a cleaner API, this one\u2019s for you \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n## \u26a1 Instant keyboard dismissal\\n\\nBy default keyboard opens and closes with animation. But in some cases you might want to dismiss the keyboard **instantly** - for example when you use a fancy shared transitions and don\'t want keyboard animation to distract your users:\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/instant-dismiss.mp4\\" width={35} />\\n<br />\\n\\nIn this release I\'ve added a new option for `KeyboardController.dismiss` method that allows you to do that. You can pass `animated` prop to control whether the keyboard should be animated or not:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nKeyboardController.dismiss({ animated: false });\\n```\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc40 Support for RN 0.80+\\n\\nThe library was compatible with RN 0.80+, but this version resolves some edge cases and assures that everything works as expected.\\n\\nIf you are using RN 0.80+ - feel free to upgrade to the latest version of the lib.\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd14 What\'s next?\\n\\nAs always, my top focus is **resolving open issues** and keeping the library stable for everyone:\\n\\n- Issues with more \ud83d\udc4d reactions are prioritized first \u2014 that\u2019s how I track what matters most to the community.\\n- Issues labeled \u201csponsor \ud83d\udc96\u201d receive **highest priority** as part of dedicated sponsor support.\\n\\nAs always stay tuned and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

Let\'s dive \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83e\udde9 New `KeyboardExtender` component\\n\\nUntil now, `react-native-keyboard-controller` has been your go-to tool for:\\n\\n- Avoiding the keyboard overlap with views;\\n- Building additional helpers for keyboard interactions (i. e. `KeyboardToolbar`);\\n- And presenting content **over** the keyboard using `OverKeyboardView`.\\n\\nBut this release goes a step further. It opens up a **new dimension** in how you \u2014 as a developer \u2014 can **collaborate** with the keyboard, rather than just react to it. So... \ud83e\udd41\\n\\nThis release brings a new component to the table \u2014 `KeyboardExtender`.\\n\\nimport Lottie from \\"lottie-react\\";\\nimport KeyboardExtender from \\"../../docs/api/views/keyboard-extender/keyboard-extender.lottie.json\\";\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \\"center\\", marginBottom: 20 }}>\\n  <Lottie\\n    className=\\"lottie\\"\\n    animationData={KeyboardExtender}\\n    style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}\\n    loop\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nWith `KeyboardExtender`, you\u2019re not just avoiding the keyboard \u2014 you\u2019re **designing experiences that live within it**. This allows you to create rich, contextual UI that feels like a natural extension of the keyboard itself.\\n\\nFor example, if you\'re building a **money transfer** or **payment** app, you can now display a predefined set of quick-select amounts (e.g., $5, $10, $20) **inside the keyboard space** \u2014 making the experience more fluid and faster for your users.\\n\\nimport Swiper from \\"@site/src/components/Swiper\\";\\n\\nimport Chrome from \\"./images/chrome.png\\";\\nimport RevolutMath from \\"./images/revolut-math.png\\";\\nimport RevolutPresets from \\"./images/revolut-presets.png\\";\\n\\n<Swiper images={[RevolutPresets, RevolutMath, Chrome]} />\\n\\n> Thanks to [Amur](https://github.com/Amurmurmur) for sparking the idea behind this component! \ud83d\udca1\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfa8 New `KeyboardBackgroundView` component\\n\\nWhile the `KeyboardExtender` is a powerful addition \u2014 and will no doubt become a favorite among many React Native developers \u2014 there are times when you want **more control**.\\n\\nSometimes, you need to build your **own accessories** \u2014 custom UI that appears _alongside_ the keyboard, sticks to it seamlessly, and **feels like** a natural extension of the system keyboard. That\u2019s exactly where the `KeyboardBackgroundView` shines.\\n\\nimport KeyboardBackgroundView from \\"../../docs/api/views/keyboard-background-view/keyboard-background-view.lottie.json\\";\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \\"center\\", marginBottom: 20 }}>\\n  <Lottie\\n    className=\\"lottie\\"\\n    animationData={KeyboardBackgroundView}\\n    style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}\\n    loop\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nThis low-level primitive has a **very specific mission**: to **visually match** the keyboard\u2019s background \u2014 giving you the flexibility to place custom elements that _blend in perfectly_. It allows you to create UI that looks and feels like part of the keyboard, even though it technically isn\u2019t.\\n\\nIn the wild, many native iOS apps use this technique to elevate their UX \u2014 such as Safari and Photos:\\n\\nimport ComparisonTable from \\"@site/src/components/ComparisonTable\\";\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<ComparisonTable\\n  left={<Video src=\\"/video/safari.mp4\\" width={51} />}\\n  right={<Video src=\\"/video/photos-app.mp4\\" width={50} />}\\n  leftText={<i>iOS Safari app.</i>}\\n  rightText={<i>iOS Photos app.</i>}\\n/>\\n\\nWith just a little creativity, `KeyboardBackgroundView` (combined with `KeyboardStickyView`) or `KeyboardExtender`, unlocks an entirely new design space.\\n\\nYou\u2019re no longer limited to **avoiding** the keyboard \u2014 you\u2019re now empowered to:\\n\\n- **Extend** the keyboard with custom actions or shortcuts;\\n- **Blend** UI elements into the keyboard area seamlessly;\\n- **Enhance** the experience by making the keyboard feel like a dynamic, interactive part of your app.\\n\\nSo instead of just _avoiding_ the keyboard... you\u2019re designing experiences that **work** with it \u2014 or even feel like **they\u2019re part** of it!\\n\\n> Huge thanks to [Seb Vidal](https://github.com/sebjvidal) for his early exploration and inspiration behind the `KeyboardBackgroundView`! \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 `useKeyboardState` with selectors\\n\\nAs of version `1.18.0`, the `useKeyboardState` hook now supports an optional `selector` argument. This enables you to **extract just the part of the keyboard state you care about**, making your components leaner and more performant.\\n\\nFor example, if you\'re only interested in the keyboard\'s `appearance` (like light or dark), you can write:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst appearance = useKeyboardState((state) => state.appearance);\\n```\\n\\nOr if you only need the current keyboard height:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst height = useKeyboardState((state) => state.height);\\n```\\n\\nBy using **selectors**, you avoid unnecessary re-renders when unrelated parts of the state change \u2014 making this a simple but powerful optimization, especially in complex UI or heavy screens (where each re-render counts).\\n\\nThis pattern is inspired by modern state management libraries (like Zustand or Redux) and allows your app to be more **reactive and efficient**, without compromising on readability.\\n\\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Preparing for deep imports deprecation\\n\\nStarting with `react-native@0.80+` the react-native team [officially deprecates](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/893) **deep imports** \u2014 a practice where internal modules are imported directly from react-native, bypassing its public API surface.\\n\\nPreviously, this library relied on some of those deep imports to access lower-level internals. But with this release, the implementation has been fully updated to align with the latest best practices.\\n\\nThat means: **no more deep import warnings cluttering your console** \u2014 everything is now future-proof and compliant with the new standards introduced in React Native 0.80+. \u2705\\n\\n## \u26a1 Preloading the keyboard to improve TTI\\n\\nMany React Native developers have noticed an annoying delay when showing the keyboard **for the first time** \u2014 especially after app launch or screen transition. This isn\u2019t a bug in `react-native-keyboard-controller`; it\u2019s a known quirk in **iOS itself**, where the keyboard can take an extra moment to initialize.\\n\\n<ComparisonTable\\n  left={<Video src=\\"/video/keyboard-without-preload.mp4\\" width={65} />}\\n  right={<Video src=\\"/video/keyboard-with-preload.mp4\\" width={65} />}\\n  leftText={<i>The keyboard appears after a significant delay</i>}\\n  rightText={<i>The keyboard appears instantly</i>}\\n/>\\n\\nTo address this, a new `preload()` method has been added to proactively warm up the keyboard **before** the user focuses the first input:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nKeyboardController.preload();\\n```\\n\\nIf you already use `react-native-keyboard-controller` and your app is wrapped in `KeyboardProvider`, then you get this optimization **automatically** \u2014 no extra code required! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nIf you find that keyboard preloading introduces any unexpected behavior in your app, you can disable it via the `preload` prop:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { KeyboardProvider } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  return <KeyboardProvider preload={false}>{/* ... */}</KeyboardProvider>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you run into issues with this feature, feel free to open an issue \u2014 your feedback helps improve the default behavior and documentation for everyone!\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcdc Full window `TextInputs` support for `KeyboardAwareScrollView`\\n\\nIn this release, `KeyboardAwareScrollView` removes a long-standing limitation: it now **fully supports** `TextInput`s **that occupy the entire screen height**, such as full-screen note editors or message composer fields.\\n\\nThis improvement required a significant internal refactor, and as a result, there\u2019s **one important change** to be aware of: previously, the `bottomOffset` prop controlled the distance between the **keyboard and the bottom of the** `TextInput`. Now, it controls the distance between the **keyboard** and **the caret (cursor)** inside the focused `TextInput`.\\n\\nIf your layout was tuned for the old behavior, you might need to slightly **increase** `bottomOffset` to maintain the same visual spacing. In most cases, though, this change should improve the user experience without requiring adjustments.\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd14 What\'s next?\\n\\nWith the upcoming public release of **iOS 26** and the anticipated redesign in **Android 16**, the near-term focus for `react-native-keyboard-controller` will be on **stability and bug fixes**.\\n\\nThe goal is to ensure that all existing features work reliably across platforms and OS versions, while maintaining the smooth keyboard experience you\'ve come to expect.\\n\\nFeel free to start to use `KeyboardExtender` and `KeyboardBackgroundView` components and share on Twitter what you\'ve build with it \ud83d\ude0d\\n\\nStay tuned and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

But many developers ended up writing their own wrappers to sync those events with `ref` or `state` variables.\\n\\nIn version `1.15.0`, the `KeyboardController.state()` API was introduced to read the keyboard state without needing a listener. However, if you wanted to react to keyboard changes (like conditionally rendering a component) you still had to use `KeyboardEvents` and deal with boilerplate code.\\n\\n**That\u2019s no longer the case!** With this release, you can use the new `useKeyboardState` hook to track the keyboard in a clean, declarative way. \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nAlso, `KeyboardController.state()` has been improved \u2014 it now always returns a defined value, so you no longer need optional chaining to safely access the keyboard state.\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddf1 Custom C++ Shadow Nodes\\n\\nWhen `OverKeyboardView` was introduced, there was an issue on Android/Fabric: the view couldn\u2019t stretch to full screen. That\u2019s because layout is now calculated in C++, and resizing your component requires updating state in C++ as well.\\n\\nAt the time, I released `OverKeyboardView` with this limitation since there were a lot of other moving pieces \u2014 and gradual rollout was the right choice. But now that the new architecture is the default in React Native, it\u2019s time to address the problem.\\n\\nStarting with this release, custom (non-auto-generated) C++ shadow nodes are included. This makes `OverKeyboardView` work as expected under the Fabric renderer.\\n\\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **If you hit any build issues, make a [clean](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/issues/786#issuecomment-2741464142) build and try again.

Think of it as a bridge release \u2014 stabilizing key parts of the system to unlock bigger things coming soon \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What\'s next?\\n\\nAs always, my top priority is resolving open issues. Beyond that, here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up:\\n\\n- Support for `react-native@0.79`;\\n- A new `KeyboardExtender` component that gets embedded directly into the keyboard;\\n- `KeyboardToolbar.Group` component to split multiple inputs into groups, each with its own navigation and state;\\n- A complete rewrite of `KeyboardAwareScrollView` that will use cursor position instead of layout-based detection.\\n\\nStay tuned and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

Currently, it supports the `offset` property, but I plan to add more features soon. \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n## `useFocusedInput` improvements\\n\\n### More Accurate Selection Events\\n\\n#### Improved precision\\n\\nPreviously, `onSelectionChange`events could produce imprecise coordinates, especially when using different `paddingTop`/`paddingBottom` values or the `textAlignVertical` property.\\n\\nThis update fixes those inaccuracies, ensuring more precise coordinates and eliminating the need for workarounds to align positioning between Android and iOS.\\n\\n#### Fully compatible with iOS < 13\\n\\n`onSelectionChange` didn\u2019t work for single-line `TextInput`s on iOS versions below 13. This issue has now been resolved, ensuring compatibility across all iOS versions.\\n\\n### Works Seamlessly with Stripe Inputs on Android\\n\\nPreviously, some third-party SDKs, like **Stripe**, used custom `EditText` subclasses that caused issues when casting to `ReactEditText`, preventing the library from recognizing focused inputs.\\n\\nI\u2019ve reworked the code to interact directly with `EditText` whenever possible, ensuring full compatibility with **Stripe** and other third-party SDKs.\\n\\n### No crashes on iOS\\n\\nWhile rare, some users experienced crashes due to incorrect Key-Value Observing (KVO) removal when attempting to remove KVO from a view that doesn\u2019t have it.\\n\\nThis release introduces a block-based KVO handling approach, eliminating those crashes.\\n\\n### More Robust Focus Detection (Even When the Keyboard Is Hidden)\\n\\nPreviously, the library relied on the `keyboardWillShow` event as an indicator that an input field was focused. However, this event doesn\u2019t always trigger\u2014such as when using a physical keyboard or setting `showSoftInputOnFocus={false}`.\\n\\nNow, focus detection has been improved to work reliably even without keyboard events.\\n\\n## New `preserveEdgeToEdge` prop for `KeyboardProvider`\\n\\nThanks to [Mathieu Acthernoene](https://github.com/zoontek), `preserveEdgeToEdge` has been introduced! This property lets you control whether `edge-to-edge` mode is disabled when calling `setEnabled(false)`, or if you want to keep it enabled.\\n\\nWith `edge-to-edge` mode becoming the standard, this option helps prevent conflicts with other libraries.\\n\\n## Improved animation performance\\n\\nWhile most users won\u2019t notice a difference (since before animations were already computed in under `1ms`), I\u2019ve made further optimizations to improve performance.\\n\\nEven small performance gains are valuable, as they free up CPU resources for other intensive tasks \u2014 such as `ShadowTree` traversal in `react-native-reanimated`.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nAs always, my immediate priority is addressing open issues. Additionally, I have plans for upcoming updates:\\n\\n- Adding support for `react-native@0.77`;\\n- A major rewrite of `KeyboardAwareScrollView` to consider cursor positioning (this release lays the groundwork by improving event precision to minimize breaking changes in the future).\\n\\nStay tuned and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

Typically many developers were using one time listener that was resolving a promise or executing the code that had to be executed after keyboard dismissal. The code could look like this:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport {\\n  KeyboardController,\\n  KeyboardEvents,\\n} from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nconst subscription = KeyboardEvents.addListener(\\"keyboardDidHide\\", () => {\\n  setVisible(true);\\n  subscription.remove();\\n});\\n\\nKeyboardController.dismiss();\\n```\\n\\nNow, `dismiss` returns a promise, so you can use it in `async` way:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nawait KeyboardController.dismiss();\\nsetVisible(true);\\n```\\n\\nMuch cleaner and more readable code! \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\n### `dismiss` now blurs input by default\\n\\nThe previous behavior of `dismiss` was keeping the focus on the input on Android and blurring the input on iOS. This behavior was not very intuitive and such inconsistency could causing a lot of issues. Now, the default behavior is to blur the input on both platforms \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nThough a rhetorical question might be raised - **\\"I liked the old behavior, when input still hold the focus \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. How to restore a previous behavior?\\"** We hear you! \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n### `dismiss` now accepts a `keepFocus` parameter\\n\\nSometimes you might want to keep the focus on the input, even after keyboard is dismissed. This way users can understand which field was focused the last. If you want to achieve this behavior, you can pass `keepFocus` parameter to `dismiss` method:\\n\\n```ts\\nKeyboardController.dismiss({ keepFocus: true });\\n```\\n\\n## New `KeyboardController` API methods\\n\\nWe finished with dismissal part. But the counter part of dismissal is the checking current keyboard state. This release is packed with 2 new methods that aims to simplify the keyboard state checks and achieve a parity with `react-native` API \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n### New `isVisible` method\\n\\nThis method acts as a `Keyboard.isVisible()` method from `react-native` and returns `true` if keyboard is currently visible and `false` otherwise.\\n\\nYou can use it to check keyboard visibility on demand without a need to create listeners.\\n\\n### New `.state()` method\\n\\nThe new method returns the last keyboard state. It returns `null` if keyboard was not shown in the app yet.\\n\\nThis method acts similar to `Keyboard.metrics()` from `react-native` and returns the current keyboard state. The reason why it is named `state` instead of `metrics` is because it returns a different data structure and it\'s not a drop-in replacement for `Keyboard.metrics()`. However you can achieve the same results using `KeyboardController.state()` (because it gives an access to `height` value) and even more - you can use other properties, such as `type`, `appearance`, `target`, `timestamp` etc. to get more information about the keyboard.\\n\\n## Better `KeyboardStickyView` and `KeyboardToolbar` interoperability\\n\\n`KeyboardStickyView` and `KeyboardToolbar` also got some useful improvements \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n### `KeyboardToolbar` now accepts `KeyboardStickyView` props\\n\\nThe `KeyboardToolbar` is based on `KeyboardStickyView`. However before it wasn\'t exposing some of `KeyboardStickyView` properties.\\n\\nI fixed that problem and `KeyboardToolbar` now accepts the same properties that `KeyboardStickyView` has, thus making a better interoperability between these two components.\\n\\n### `KeyboardStickyView` got new `enabled` prop\\n\\nBefore `KeyboardAwareScrollView` and `KeyboardAvoidingView` had `enabled` property, but somehow I forgot to add that property to `KeyboardStickyView` \ud83d\ude2c. The `1.15.0` release fixes this problem and now `KeyboardStickyView` also has `enabled` property.\\n\\nWhen this property is turned on, then `KeyboardStickyView` follows the keyboard. When property disabled, then it just moves the component into a position as keyboard wasn\'t shown yet.\\n\\n## `KeyboardEvents` metadata enhancements\\n\\nThis release enhances `KeyboardEventData` with new properties.\\n\\n### New `type` property\\n\\nIn this release I added new `type` property which reflects [keyboardType](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#keyboardtype) value. Using this property you can understand more about which keyboard type is shown at the moment.\\n\\n### New `appearance` property\\n\\nThis release adds a new `appearance` property which reflects keyboard appearance and can be one of `light`/`dark`/`default` values. This property is available on iOS and Android.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThe main goal of this release was making `KeyboardGestureArea` available on iOS. I implemented necessary changes in [this PR](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/727) (which would allow to use `offset` property for interactive dismissal). But when I decided to test Fabric I discovered many issues, which basically makes this component unusable on iOS. Since I already merged many PRs that extend library functionality I decided not to pause release process for months and prepare `1.15.0` now.

It\'s a great way to create a _modal-like_ experience with a natural transitions between windows in your application without closing or hiding the keyboard. Say \\"no\\" to instant keyboard transitions, jumps, glitches, bouncy UI and other things and use the component that \\"just works\\":\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<div style={{ paddingBottom: 20 }}>\\n  <Video src=\\"/video/over-keyboard-view-shared-transitions.mp4\\" width={30} />\\n</div>\\n\\nThis component is perfect for countless applications! Whether you\'re building a photo gallery app or crafting a custom context menu that floats seamlessly over the screen (keeping the content behind visible while keyboard stays open) - the `OverKeyboardView` is the solution you\'ve been waiting for!\\n\\n## How to use it?\\n\\nTo use `OverKeyboardView` you need to wrap your content with it and pass `visible` prop to it. When `visible` is `true` the content will be displayed over the keyboard.\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { OverKeyboardView } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nconst App = () => {\\n  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <OverKeyboardView visible={visible}>\\n      {/* Your content here */}\\n    </OverKeyboardView>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nYou can also check a dedicated [API page](/docs/api/views/over-keyboard-view) to learn more about it.\\n\\n## What\'s else packed in a new release?\\n\\nApart of a new feature this release contains mostly bugfixes that touches an integration aspect, such as:\\n\\n- `KeyboardToolbar` can work in `Modal` on Android ([#590](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/590));\\n- `KeyboardAwareScrollView` can use `ScrollView` from `react-native-gesture-handler` ([#595](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/595));\\n- `OverKeyboardView` in invisible state is not hiding `ScrollView` ([#598](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/598));\\n- `OverKeyboardView` works with `GestureDetector` on Android ([#602](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/602));\\n\\nOther than that I also improved documentation of the package, update linters and did other various maintenance tasks.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nI see that the library becomes more and more popular, and next several months I\'d like to focus on making stability of this library better. It\'s already pretty stable and good, but when it comes to the integration in big projects people are encountering some issues and reporting it. So my near-term goal is to improve the stability of the library and make it more stable for everyone.\\n\\nIf you have a pain-points when you have to deal with keyboard in `react-native` applications, please feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues or pull requests on GitHub.

With better support for `Modal` components, dynamic `StatusBar` translucency, and new customization options for `KeyboardGestureArea`s, this release is designed to make your development process smoother and your app\'s user experience more seamless. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n## Key features\\n\\n### `Modal` support on Android\\n\\nStarting from the very first version of this library it was impossible to use the functionality of this library inside the `Modal`. It was caused by next factors:\\n\\n- the `Modal` window lives in its own view hierarchy;\\n- `react-native` set `adjustResize` mode to `window` of the `Modal`.\\n\\nAs a result whenever you try to use `react-native-keyboard-controller` inside the `Modal` you will get a default behavior (but sometimes even mixed behavior, i. e. hooks will report keyboard height and `Modal` content will be automatically resized).\\n\\nAs a temporary workaround people simply disabled the module (to fallback to a fully default behavior):\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { useKeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\n// ... somewhere in your modal screen ...\\n\\nconst { enabled, setEnabled } = useKeyboardController();\\n\\nuseEffect(() => {\\n  setEnabled(false);\\n}, []);\\n```\\n\\nWhile it was working approach it still had some downsides, such as inconsistent keyboard handling/animations across the app.\\n\\nWith the new release it\'s not a problem anymore - now you can use all hooks and components inside the `Modal` without additional hassle and it will just work out of the box:\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/modal-integration-demo.mp4\\" width={30} />\\n\\n### Support for `StatusBar.translucent`\\n\\nThe `StatusBar` integration was always a problematic because `react-native` uses deprecated methods that eventually breaks keyboard events. This module exports its own `StatusBarManagerCompat` module and uses this module automatically to handle `StatusBar` changes.\\n\\nThe problem was in the fact that `StatusBarManagerCompat` module didn\'t react on `translucent` prop changes. Now it\'s not the case and you can disable/enable `translucent` property dynamically.\\n\\n:::info\\nYou may think that `statusBarTranslucent` prop on `KeyboardProvider` is not needed anymore, but I would recommend to keep it - it\'ll help to layout `KeyboardProvider` properly in one frame without frame jumps.\\n:::\\n\\n### New `offset` prop for `KeyboardGestureArea`\\n\\nStarting from this release I\'m adding more customization to interactive keyboard handling. On `Android` now you can add `offset` property (which can be equal to your `TextInput` height) to your `KeyboardGestureArea` component - it\'ll allow you to extend the keyboard area and start dismiss gesture starting from the `TextInput` top border and not from the keyboard itself.\\n\\nimport ComparisonTable from \\"@site/src/components/ComparisonTable\\";\\n\\n<ComparisonTable\\n  left={\\n    <Video src=\\"/video/keyboard-gesture-area-without-offset.mp4\\" width={65} />\\n  }\\n  right={\\n    <Video src=\\"/video/keyboard-gesture-area-with-offset.mp4\\" width={65} />\\n  }\\n  leftText={\\n    <i>\\n      The keyboard movement starts only when you cross the top border of the\\n      keyboard\\n    </i>\\n  }\\n  rightText={\\n    <i>\\n      The keyboard movement starts only when you cross the top border of your{\\" \\"}\\n      <code>TextInput</code>\\n    </i>\\n  }\\n/>\\n\\n### `react-native@0.75` support\\n\\nThis release brings support for `react-native@0.75`. Even though `1.12.x` should be also compatible with `react-native@0.75` I still would recommend you to update this library to `1.13.0` if you are running your project on `react-native@0.75` (especially if you are using new architecture).\\n\\n### An ability to prevent default actions in `KeyboardToolbar`\\n\\nStarting from `1.12.0` you had an ability to customize the behavior of `KeyboardToolbar` buttons - you could run additional actions (add haptic feedback, for example). However before it wasn\'t possible to prevent default actions from happening, i. e. if you pressed next button, then focus would move to the next input.\\n\\nWith this release you can prevent default actions from happening by calling `e.preventDefault()` in `onNextCallback`, `onPrevCallback`, and `onDoneCallback` callbacks.\\n\\nI think it\'s a great addition to the existing functionality, because sometimes you may need to have this. For example, if you have a custom input between two `TextInput`s (let\'s say a calendar picker) and when you press the next button (while you have a focus on the first input) - most likely you want to open a calendar picker. But with default behavior you will skip a calendar picker and will instantly move to the second input. Using new functionality you can call `e.preventDefault()` conditionally and perform your own action to achieve your custom requirements!\\n\\n### Synchronous `worklet` handler mount\\n\\nHooks such as `useKeyboardHandler` or `useFocusedInputHandler` were mounting `worklet` handlers asynchronously. In most of the cases it wasn\'t a problem, but if the keyboard performs an animation and `worklet` handler is not attached yet, then you will get a broken layout - keyboard will overlap elements etc.\\n\\nThis release fixes this issue by mounting `worklet` handlers synchronously so it\'s not a problem anymore! \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n### Other bug fixes and improvements\\n\\nAmong all other improvements this release also includes a bunch of fixes, such as:\\n\\n- proper `ref` de-allocation for `KeyboardAwareScrollView`;\\n- better accessibility labels for `KeyboardToolbar`;\\n- incorrect `height`/`progress` values in `onEnd`/`didShow` events on iOS when keyboard appearance has two stages (i. e. you are using `secureTextEntry` prop on `TextInput`).\\n\\nAlso this release aims to improve the stability of this library - I added a bunch of **e2e** tests and added scripts for running them on more devices. If before I used only **iOS 17** simulator and **Android 9** emulator, now I\'m using **iOS 16/17/18** (yes, I\'m testing on _**beta**_ iOS releases too \ud83d\ude0e) simulators and **Android 9/12** emulators.\\n\\nI hope such setup can help to catch bugs on as early stage as possible. But I\'m not going to stop here - I\'m also planning to add more tests, more runtimes (Android 15 is planned) and improve the stability of this library even more.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThe new `1.13.0` release is just a better revision of the `1.12.0` release. But since it brings quite a lot of new features and improvements I decided to publish it as a separate release. \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nI\'m planning to continuously improve this library and add more features. The ultimate goal is to fix all the bugs and implement all requested features. \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nIf you have a pain-points when you have to deal with keyboard in `react-native` applications, please feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues or pull requests on GitHub.

Starting from `1.12.0` this library exposes a new event and handlers making it possible to track selection changes.\\n\\nIn addition to duplicating the react-native API, this event provides information not only about the `start` and `end` positions but also the `x` and `y` coordinates for the top-left and bottom-right corners of the selection.\\n\\nThese details allow you to draw elements behind the cursor, making interaction with focused inputs more intuitive:\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/selection-demo.mov\\" width={65} />\\n<br />\\n\\nLater on I\'m planning to extend `KeyboardAwareScrollView` to react on selection tracking, so if your selection is overlapped with keyboard then `KeyboardAwareScrollView` will automatically scroll and avoid an overlap.\\n\\n## `KeyboardToolbar` enhancements\\n\\nThe `KeyboardToolbar` component was initially introduced in version `1.10.0`. In this release, I\'ve added new features to make it even more customizable and HID compatible.\\n\\n### `blur` effect\\n\\nStarting with version `1.12.0`, you can apply a blur effect to the `KeyboardToolbar` component by using the `blur` prop. You can use any compatible component, such as `react-native-blur` or `expo-blur`. Since iOS 16, the keyboard itself is translucent with a blur effect, which causes all components behind it to be blurred too.\\n\\nWith the new version of `react-native-keyboard-controller`, you can extend this effect to the `KeyboardToolbar` component! \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n### Button callbacks\\n\\nFrom version `1.12.0`, the `KeyboardToolbar` component supports various callbacks for specific events, such as `onNextCallback`, `onPrevCallback`, and `onDoneCallback`.\\n\\nThese callbacks let you add **haptic** feedback, **play sounds**, or implement other creative responses based on your needs.\\n\\n## Synchronous `onMove` handler on iOS\\n\\nSince version `1.4.0`, when the `useKeyboardHandler` hook was introduced, the `onMove` handler was always a frame behind.\\n\\nAs a result, it created a parallax effect that prevented elements from precisely following the keyboard.\\n\\nWith a new release this problem is solved, and the `onMove` handler is now synchronized with the keyboard animation. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n## No need to patch `react-native-text-input-mask` anymore\\n\\nIf you used `react-native-text-input-mask` alongside `useFocusedInputHandler` or `KeyboardAwareScrollView`, you might have needed to patch it to ensure that the `onChangeText` event was triggered.\\n\\nWith the new release of `react-native-keyboard-controller`, you can now safely remove this patch and keep your existing code intact. \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThis release refines the previous version and at the same time introduces crucial improvements that will unlock the full potential of `react-native-keyboard-controller` in future updates:\\n\\n- on iOS, we now inject a delegate into `TextInput`, providing greater control over input and keyboard events;\\n- the fully synchronous `onMove` handler will enable frame-by-frame keyboard control in the future, particularly when an interactive keyboard offset is implemented. \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nTo stay tuned follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

Recognizing this, I set out to redefine the keyboard experience, making it more intuitive, seamless, and, most importantly, tailored to your users needs. So I\'m happy to reveal `KeyboardToolbar` - a sleek, customizable toolbar that sticks to your keyboard like a faithful companion, ready to streamline your typing journey. \ud83d\ude0d\\n\\n## Why do I need another toolbar component if `react-native-keyboard-manager` already provides an implementation?\\n\\nWhile `react-native-keyboard-manager` offers a toolbar component powered by `IQKeyboardManager`, it still lack some features, such as:\\n\\n- missing Android support;\\n- lack of full customization (you can not render custom content/buttons/icons, perform custom actions on clicks, etc.);\\n- issues when integrating custom input components (date pickers, bottom sheets, etc.).\\n\\nTaking all these points into consideration, I decided to create a **new** component that would overcome these limitations, while at the same time maintaining a simple API so that developers can easily work with it.\\n\\nI was inspired by `IQKeyboardManager` functionality and its ease of integration into iOS projects, so I decided to replicate their algorithms for view traversal on both Android and iOS.\\n\\nFor sure, the current implementation only covers basic use cases, but I plan to extend the functionality to cover more and more various edge cases in the future. \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n## The simple API behind a new component\\n\\nThe UI of the new component is implemented using `react-native` primitives (thus allowing great customization). However, the functionality for moving focus to `next` and `previous` fields is implemented on the native side and is powered by a simple API:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\n// this will move focus to the next TextInput\\nKeyboardController.setFocusTo(\\"next\\");\\n// or if we want to set focus to previous field\\nKeyboardController.setFocusTo(\\"prev\\");\\n```\\n\\nLast but not least - the new API allows you to restore focus to the last focused input \ud83e\udd2f. To achieve this, you should use:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\n// if keyboard is closed - it\'ll restore a focus\\n// if keyboard is open - it will not do anything\\nKeyboardController.setFocusTo(\\"current\\");\\n```\\n\\nSo, as you can see, for simple navigation to `next` and `previous` fields, you don\'t need to create a complex solutions with an array of `refs` in JS code - now it\'s powered by the new API of this library and allows you to delegate control to the library and simplify your codebase \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n## Instead of summary\\n\\nAs I roll out the `KeyboardToolbar`, I invite you to join me in this exciting journey. Elevate your app\'s user experience, redefine keyboard interaction, and watch as your users engage with your app in ways never imagined before. Stay tuned for more updates, and get ready to embrace the future of keyboard navigation.\\n\\nTo start to use this feature install the latest `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.11.0` and add this component into your app. \ud83d\ude0e Also don\'t forget to check [example](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/tree/main/example) app to see how it\'s implemented there \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

This update brings two powerful new features to help you manage the keyboard behavior in your React Native applications. Whether you\'re building a simple form or a complex UI, these additions will make your life easier \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nimport Lottie from \\"lottie-react\\";\\nimport lottie from \\"../../docs/api/components/keyboard-sticky-view/ksv.lottie.json\\";\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \\"center\\", marginBottom: 20 }}>\\n  <Lottie\\n    className=\\"lottie\\"\\n    animationData={lottie}\\n    style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}\\n    loop\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### `KeyboardStickyView`\\n\\n`KeyboardStickyView` is a new component that simplifies handling keyboard interactions in your React Native applications. With this component, you can easily ensure that the content inside remains visible, accessible and is sticky to the keyboard movement. Here are some of the key features:\\n\\n- **Auto-Adjustment**: The `KeyboardStickyView` automatically adjusts the position of your UI components when the keyboard is displayed, ensuring that your content inside a container remains visible.\\n- **Customizable Behavior**: You have full control over how the UI adjusts when the keyboard is shown or hidden. You can specify `offset` property and it\'ll automatically interpolate values based on keyboard animation to make the transition seamless.\\n- **Universal Compatibility**: Whether your users are on Android or iOS, `KeyboardStickyView` ensures that your content remains accessible and visible, even when the keyboard appears. No more platform-specific quirks; it just works.\\n- **Custom Content**: The flexibility of `KeyboardStickyView` shines as you can place any content inside it. It\'s perfect for multi-step flows, chats, or any scenario where you need buttons and widgets to remain easily accessible when the keyboard is up.\\n- **Effortless Integration**: Implementing `KeyboardStickyView` in your app is a breeze. Just wrap your UI elements within this component, and it takes care of the rest. It automatically adjusts the position of your UI components as the keyboard is shown or hidden.\\n\\n### `useReanimatedFocusedInput` hook\\n\\nThis hook represents a significant evolution from the features introduced in the `1.6.0` release. In `1.6.0`, a new `target` property was introduced to fetch the layout of the currently focused `TextInput`. While it served its purpose, it came with a set of challenges:\\n\\n- **Complex Setup on Fabric Architecture**: Setting up this feature on the new Fabric architecture posed complications, including the use of deprecated APIs like `findNodeHandle`.\\n- **Inconsistencies Across Architectures**: The measurements could sometimes yield different results depending on the underlying architecture in use.\\n- **Inability to Detect Layout Changes**: It lacked the ability to detect layout changes for the focused `TextInput` within the library\'s ecosystem.\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, the decision was made to enhance the library\'s capabilities and introduce a new hook that simplifies interactions with the API while addressing the issues mentioned above. And thus, I present to you...\ud83e\udd41\\n\\nThe new `useReanimatedFocusedInput` hook \ud83d\ude0e. This hook eliminates the need for integrating or using third-party elements, ensuring consistent functionality across all platforms and architectures. Its standout feature is its ability to detect events crucial for building robust keyboard handling, even beyond direct keyboard interactions, such as the detection of layout changes.\\n\\nWith `useReanimatedFocusedInput`, I\'ve created a more streamlined and versatile solution to meet your needs.\\n\\n## Achieved milestones\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf89 Celebrating 1000 Stars: A Heartfelt Thank You to Our Incredible Community \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nThe `react-native-keyboard-controller` has reached an incredible milestone - **1000** stars! \ud83d\ude80 This achievement wouldn\'t have been possible without the unwavering support and contributions from amazing community of developers and enthusiasts.\\n\\nI want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who has been a part of this journey.

With this latest release, I introduce the `useKeyboardController` hook and `setEnabled` method, which allows for a gradual integration of the library into your project, enabling you to disable the module on specific screens as needed. This flexible feature ensures that your app\'s keyboard behavior remains seamless and user-friendly.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s New in Version 1.8.0: The `setEnabled` Hook\\n\\nThe star feature of `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.8.0` is the introduction of the `setEnabled` method. This method provides developers with granular control over when and where the library\'s keyboard management should be active.\\n\\n### How to Use `setEnabled`\\n\\nUsing the `setEnabled` method is incredibly straightforward. Here\'s a quick example of how to integrate it into your React Native project:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { useKeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nconst { enabled, setEnabled } = useKeyboardController();\\n\\n// if you want to know whether is module active at the moment\\nconsole.log(enabled);\\n\\n// disable keyboard controller on a specific screen\\nsetEnabled(false);\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we\'re importing the `useKeyboardController` hook from the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library. This hook returns `setEnabled` method (which you can use to disable keyboard management for a specific screen) and `enabled` variable (indicating whether the module is active now or not).\\n\\nWhen you disable the module using `setEnabled(false)`, the screen will fallback to the default `Android` behavior, automatically resizing based on `AndroidManifest` preferences (`android:windowSoftInputMode`). This level of control allows you to tailor the keyboard experience to your app\'s unique needs on a per-screen basis.\\n\\n### Use Cases for `setEnabled`\\n\\nThe `setEnabled` method is incredibly versatile and can be employed in various scenarios:\\n\\n- **Forms**: Disable keyboard management on screens with simple forms that don\'t require custom keyboard management.\\n\\n- **Chat Interfaces**: Keep keyboard management enabled for chat screens, ensuring smooth and consistent user experiences during messaging interactions.\\n\\n- **Gradual Integration**: Tailor keyboard functionality on specific pages where you require precise control over how the keyboard behaves, while leaving other screens unaffected by these adjustments.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n`react-native-keyboard-controller` continues to evolve, making it an essential tool for React Native developers who want to provide exceptional user experiences in their mobile apps.\\n\\nWith the introduction of the `setEnabled` method in version `1.8.0`, you now have even more control over keyboard behavior, ensuring that your app feels polished and responsive \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nTo get started with the latest version, check out the [official documentation](../) and explore the new possibilities that the `setEnabled` method offers.\\n\\nUpgrade your React Native project today and take your keyboard management to the next level with `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.8.0`!\\n\\nStay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library.

It\'s especially important when you want your app to look and feel polished on both `iOS` and `Android` devices. While the built-in `KeyboardAvoidingView` component in React Native works well for `iOS`, it doesn\'t provide the same level of smoothness and consistency on `Android`.\\n\\nI have been hard at work, and in this upcoming release, I\'m thrilled to unveil the enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`. With this component, you can achieve a seamless keyboard animation experience across both major platforms \u2013 `iOS` and `Android`.\\n\\n## Features of `KeyboardAvoidingView`\\n\\n### Platform-agnostic Animation\\n\\nWith the new `KeyboardAvoidingView`, you can say goodbye to platform-specific workarounds. This component is designed to work harmoniously on both `iOS` and `Android`, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout your app.\\n\\n### Smoother Animations\\n\\nThe enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView` offers smoother and more natural animations when the keyboard appears or disappears. This means your UI elements will gracefully adjust to accommodate the keyboard, preventing awkward overlaps and ensuring your users can interact with your app seamlessly.\\n\\n### Backward Compatible and Seamless Integration\\n\\nI understand the importance of maintaining compatibility with existing code bases and providing a smooth transition for React Native developers. With enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I\'ve put compatibility at the forefront of design principles.\\n\\nThe `KeyboardAvoidingView` is crafted to seamlessly integrate with your existing React Native projects. It\'s a **drop-in** replacement for the default React Native `KeyboardAvoidingView` component. This means that you can start using an enhanced version without the need for extensive code modifications or rewrites.\\n\\nWhether you\'re working on a brand-new project or updating an existing app, making the switch to re-implemented `KeyboardAvoidingView` is as simple as updating your import statements. Your existing codebase remains intact, and the benefits of smoother animations and cross-platform compatibility come without the hassle \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n### Customizable\\n\\nI believe that the best tools are those that adapt to your unique project requirements. That\'s why I\'m excited to introduce a dedicated avenue for customization. If you find that the default behavior of `KeyboardAvoidingView` doesn\'t precisely align with your app\'s needs, I encourage you to explore the possibilities of customization \ud83e\udd13\\n\\n#### Share Your Ideas and Report Bugs \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nYour feedback is invaluable to me. If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or you encounter any issues while using `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I invite you to get involved. Feel free to submit your suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports through my [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller) repository.\\n\\nThe community is built on collaboration, and together, I believe we can make this library even better. By actively participating and sharing your insights, you contribute to the growth and enhancement of `react-native-keyboard-controller` and `KeyboardAvoidingView` in a particular.\\n\\n## What\'s Coming Next\\n\\nWhile I\'m excited to introduce the `KeyboardAvoidingView` in this release, my commitment to making your React Native development experience smoother doesn\'t stop here. I have big plans to expand the library with more pre-built components designed to simplify complex tasks related to keyboard handling.\\n\\nIn the pipeline, you can look forward to components like `KeyboardAwareScrollView` for effortlessly managing scroll views, `StickyFooter` for keeping crucial UI elements in view, and much more. My goal is to provide you with a comprehensive toolkit for creating exceptional user interfaces in React Native.\\n\\nStay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library.

Now, you can precisely calculate the delay between an event occurring in the native thread and its propagation to JavaScript. This level of accuracy enables you to orchestrate keyboard handling with finesse, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing user experience.\\n\\n### Target: Layout mastery at your fingertips\\n\\nUnlock the potential of enhanced layout handling with the `target` field in event metadata. By accessing the view tag of the focused field, you can synchronously retrieve layout information. This newfound capability empowers you to make real-time adjustments to your UI elements based on the active input, creating a fluid and context-aware user interface.\\n\\n### Duration: Elevate animation fluidity\\n\\nExperience the art of animation depth with the `duration` field in event metadata. If you\'re aiming for parallax-like effects without the intricacies of frame-in-frame keyboard animations, this feature is your key! Define the `duration` of the keyboard animation to achieve a captivating parallax effect that adds a touch of elegance to your app\'s visual appeal.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nI\'m also excited to share a sneak peek into what\'s on the horizon \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nDuring the `1.6.0` development cycle, I\'ve delved even deeper into keyboard handling, uncovering insights that will shape the way you interact with keyboards in your React Native apps. So my investigation has inspired a new API that will make keyboard interactions more intuitive and seamless. Whether you\'re a seasoned developer or just starting out, managing keyboards will become a breeze.\\n\\nAlso I will be actively addressing GitHub issues and ensuring compatibility with the latest React Native version. My commitment to excellence means you can rely on a stable and up-to-date library \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) for updates.
