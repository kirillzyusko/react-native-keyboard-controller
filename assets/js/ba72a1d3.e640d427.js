It\'s a great way to create a _modal-like_ experience with a natural transitions between windows in your application without closing or hiding the keyboard. Say \\"no\\" to instant keyboard transitions, jumps, glitches, bouncy UI and other things and use the component that \\"just works\\":\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<div style={{ paddingBottom: 20 }}>\\n  <Video src=\\"/video/over-keyboard-view-shared-transitions.mp4\\" width={30} />\\n</div>\\n\\nThis component is perfect for countless applications! Whether you\'re building a photo gallery app or crafting a custom context menu that floats seamlessly over the screen (keeping the content behind visible while keyboard stays open) - the `OverKeyboardView` is the solution you\'ve been waiting for!\\n\\n## How to use it?\\n\\nTo use `OverKeyboardView` you need to wrap your content with it and pass `visible` prop to it. When `visible` is `true` the content will be displayed over the keyboard.\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { OverKeyboardView } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nconst App = () => {\\n  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <OverKeyboardView visible={visible}>\\n      {/* Your content here */}\\n    </OverKeyboardView>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nYou can also check a dedicated [API page](/docs/api/over-keyboard-view) to learn more about it.\\n\\n## What\'s else packed in a new release?\\n\\nApart of a new feature this release contains mostly bugfixes that touches an integration aspect, such as:\\n\\n- `KeyboardToolbar` can work in `Modal` on Android ([#590](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/590));\\n- `KeyboardAwareScrollView` can use `ScrollView` from `react-native-gesture-handler` ([#595](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/595));\\n- `OverKeyboardView` in invisible state is not hiding `ScrollView` ([#598](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/598));\\n- `OverKeyboardView` works with `GestureDetector` on Android ([#602](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/pull/602));\\n\\nOther than that I also improved documentation of the package, update linters and did other various maintenance tasks.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nI see that the library becomes more and more popular, and next several months I\'d like to focus on making stability of this library better. It\'s already pretty stable and good, but when it comes to the integration in big projects people are encountering some issues and reporting it. So my near-term goal is to improve the stability of the library and make it more stable for everyone.\\n\\nIf you have a pain-points when you have to deal with keyboard in `react-native` applications, please feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues or pull requests on GitHub.

With better support for `Modal` components, dynamic `StatusBar` translucency, and new customization options for `KeyboardGestureArea`s, this release is designed to make your development process smoother and your app\'s user experience more seamless. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n## Key features\\n\\n### `Modal` support on Android\\n\\nStarting from the very first version of this library it was impossible to use the functionality of this library inside the `Modal`. It was caused by next factors:\\n\\n- the `Modal` window lives in its own view hierarchy;\\n- `react-native` set `adjustResize` mode to `window` of the `Modal`.\\n\\nAs a result whenever you try to use `react-native-keyboard-controller` inside the `Modal` you will get a default behavior (but sometimes even mixed behavior, i. e. hooks will report keyboard height and `Modal` content will be automatically resized).\\n\\nAs a temporary workaround people simply disabled the module (to fallback to a fully default behavior):\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { useKeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\n// ... somewhere in your modal screen ...\\n\\nconst { enabled, setEnabled } = useKeyboardController();\\n\\nuseEffect(() => {\\n  setEnabled(false);\\n}, []);\\n```\\n\\nWhile it was working approach it still had some downsides, such as inconsistent keyboard handling/animations across the app.\\n\\nWith the new release it\'s not a problem anymore - now you can use all hooks and components inside the `Modal` without additional hassle and it will just work out of the box:\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/modal-integration-demo.mp4\\" width={30} />\\n\\n### Support for `StatusBar.translucent`\\n\\nThe `StatusBar` integration was always a problematic because `react-native` uses deprecated methods that eventually breaks keyboard events. This module exports its own `StatusBarManagerCompat` module and uses this module automatically to handle `StatusBar` changes.\\n\\nThe problem was in the fact that `StatusBarManagerCompat` module didn\'t react on `translucent` prop changes. Now it\'s not the case and you can disable/enable `translucent` property dynamically.\\n\\n:::info\\nYou may think that `statusBarTranslucent` prop on `KeyboardProvider` is not needed anymore, but I would recommend to keep it - it\'ll help to layout `KeyboardProvider` properly in one frame without frame jumps.\\n:::\\n\\n### New `offset` prop for `KeyboardGestureArea`\\n\\nStarting from this release I\'m adding more customization to interactive keyboard handling. On `Android` now you can add `offset` property (which can be equal to your `TextInput` height) to your `KeyboardGestureArea` component - it\'ll allow you to extend the keyboard area and start dismiss gesture starting from the `TextInput` top border and not from the keyboard itself.\\n\\nimport ComparisonTable from \\"@site/src/components/ComparisonTable\\";\\n\\n<ComparisonTable\\n  left={\\n    <Video src=\\"/video/keyboard-gesture-area-without-offset.mp4\\" width={65} />\\n  }\\n  right={\\n    <Video src=\\"/video/keyboard-gesture-area-with-offset.mp4\\" width={65} />\\n  }\\n  leftText={\\n    <i>\\n      The keyboard movement starts only when you cross the top border of the\\n      keyboard\\n    </i>\\n  }\\n  rightText={\\n    <i>\\n      The keyboard movement starts only when you cross the top border of your{\\" \\"}\\n      <code>TextInput</code>\\n    </i>\\n  }\\n/>\\n\\n### `react-native@0.75` support\\n\\nThis release brings support for `react-native@0.75`. Even though `1.12.x` should be also compatible with `react-native@0.75` I still would recommend you to update this library to `1.13.0` if you are running your project on `react-native@0.75` (especially if you are using new architecture).\\n\\n### An ability to prevent default actions in `KeyboardToolbar`\\n\\nStarting from `1.12.0` you had an ability to customize the behavior of `KeyboardToolbar` buttons - you could run additional actions (add haptic feedback, for example). However before it wasn\'t possible to prevent default actions from happening, i. e. if you pressed next button, then focus would move to the next input.\\n\\nWith this release you can prevent default actions from happening by calling `e.preventDefault()` in `onNextCallback`, `onPrevCallback`, and `onDoneCallback` callbacks.\\n\\nI think it\'s a great addition to the existing functionality, because sometimes you may need to have this. For example, if you have a custom input between two `TextInput`s (let\'s say a calendar picker) and when you press the next button (while you have a focus on the first input) - most likely you want to open a calendar picker. But with default behavior you will skip a calendar picker and will instantly move to the second input. Using new functionality you can call `e.preventDefault()` conditionally and perform your own action to achieve your custom requirements!\\n\\n### Synchronous `worklet` handler mount\\n\\nHooks such as `useKeyboardHandler` or `useFocusedInputHandler` were mounting `worklet` handlers asynchronously. In most of the cases it wasn\'t a problem, but if the keyboard performs an animation and `worklet` handler is not attached yet, then you will get a broken layout - keyboard will overlap elements etc.\\n\\nThis release fixes this issue by mounting `worklet` handlers synchronously so it\'s not a problem anymore! \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n### Other bug fixes and improvements\\n\\nAmong all other improvements this release also includes a bunch of fixes, such as:\\n\\n- proper `ref` de-allocation for `KeyboardAwareScrollView`;\\n- better accessibility labels for `KeyboardToolbar`;\\n- incorrect `height`/`progress` values in `onEnd`/`didShow` events on iOS when keyboard appearance has two stages (i. e. you are using `secureTextEntry` prop on `TextInput`).\\n\\nAlso this release aims to improve the stability of this library - I added a bunch of **e2e** tests and added scripts for running them on more devices. If before I used only **iOS 17** simulator and **Android 9** emulator, now I\'m using **iOS 16/17/18** (yes, I\'m testing on _**beta**_ iOS releases too \ud83d\ude0e) simulators and **Android 9/12** emulators.\\n\\nI hope such setup can help to catch bugs on as early stage as possible. But I\'m not going to stop here - I\'m also planning to add more tests, more runtimes (Android 15 is planned) and improve the stability of this library even more.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThe new `1.13.0` release is just a better revision of the `1.12.0` release. But since it brings quite a lot of new features and improvements I decided to publish it as a separate release. \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nI\'m planning to continuously improve this library and add more features. The ultimate goal is to fix all the bugs and implement all requested features. \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nIf you have a pain-points when you have to deal with keyboard in `react-native` applications, please feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues or pull requests on GitHub.

Starting from `1.12.0` this library exposes a new event and handlers making it possible to track selection changes.\\n\\nIn addition to duplicating the react-native API, this event provides information not only about the `start` and `end` positions but also the `x` and `y` coordinates for the top-left and bottom-right corners of the selection.\\n\\nThese details allow you to draw elements behind the cursor, making interaction with focused inputs more intuitive:\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/selection-demo.mov\\" width={65} />\\n<br />\\n\\nLater on I\'m planning to extend `KeyboardAwareScrollView` to react on selection tracking, so if your selection is overlapped with keyboard then `KeyboardAwareScrollView` will automatically scroll and avoid an overlap.\\n\\n## `KeyboardToolbar` enhancements\\n\\nThe `KeyboardToolbar` component was initially introduced in version `1.10.0`. In this release, I\'ve added new features to make it even more customizable and HID compatible.\\n\\n### `blur` effect\\n\\nStarting with version `1.12.0`, you can apply a blur effect to the `KeyboardToolbar` component by using the `blur` prop. You can use any compatible component, such as `react-native-blur` or `expo-blur`. Since iOS 16, the keyboard itself is translucent with a blur effect, which causes all components behind it to be blurred too.\\n\\nWith the new version of `react-native-keyboard-controller`, you can extend this effect to the `KeyboardToolbar` component! \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n### Button callbacks\\n\\nFrom version `1.12.0`, the `KeyboardToolbar` component supports various callbacks for specific events, such as `onNextCallback`, `onPrevCallback`, and `onDoneCallback`.\\n\\nThese callbacks let you add **haptic** feedback, **play sounds**, or implement other creative responses based on your needs.\\n\\n## Synchronous `onMove` handler on iOS\\n\\nSince version `1.4.0`, when the `useKeyboardHandler` hook was introduced, the `onMove` handler was always a frame behind.\\n\\nAs a result, it created a parallax effect that prevented elements from precisely following the keyboard.\\n\\nWith a new release this problem is solved, and the `onMove` handler is now synchronized with the keyboard animation. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n## No need to patch `react-native-text-input-mask` anymore\\n\\nIf you used `react-native-text-input-mask` alongside `useFocusedInputHandler` or `KeyboardAwareScrollView`, you might have needed to patch it to ensure that the `onChangeText` event was triggered.\\n\\nWith the new release of `react-native-keyboard-controller`, you can now safely remove this patch and keep your existing code intact. \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThis release refines the previous version and at the same time introduces crucial improvements that will unlock the full potential of `react-native-keyboard-controller` in future updates:\\n\\n- on iOS, we now inject a delegate into `TextInput`, providing greater control over input and keyboard events;\\n- the fully synchronous `onMove` handler will enable frame-by-frame keyboard control in the future, particularly when an interactive keyboard offset is implemented. \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nTo stay tuned follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

Recognizing this, I set out to redefine the keyboard experience, making it more intuitive, seamless, and, most importantly, tailored to your users needs. So I\'m happy to reveal `KeyboardToolbar` - a sleek, customizable toolbar that sticks to your keyboard like a faithful companion, ready to streamline your typing journey. \ud83d\ude0d\\n\\n## Why do I need another toolbar component if `react-native-keyboard-manager` already provides an implementation?\\n\\nWhile `react-native-keyboard-manager` offers a toolbar component powered by `IQKeyboardManager`, it still lack some features, such as:\\n\\n- missing Android support;\\n- lack of full customization (you can not render custom content/buttons/icons, perform custom actions on clicks, etc.);\\n- issues when integrating custom input components (date pickers, bottom sheets, etc.).\\n\\nTaking all these points into consideration, I decided to create a **new** component that would overcome these limitations, while at the same time maintaining a simple API so that developers can easily work with it.\\n\\nI was inspired by `IQKeyboardManager` functionality and its ease of integration into iOS projects, so I decided to replicate their algorithms for view traversal on both Android and iOS.\\n\\nFor sure, the current implementation only covers basic use cases, but I plan to extend the functionality to cover more and more various edge cases in the future. \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n## The simple API behind a new component\\n\\nThe UI of the new component is implemented using `react-native` primitives (thus allowing great customization). However, the functionality for moving focus to `next` and `previous` fields is implemented on the native side and is powered by a simple API:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\n// this will move focus to the next TextInput\\nKeyboardController.setFocusTo(\\"next\\");\\n// or if we want to set focus to previous field\\nKeyboardController.setFocusTo(\\"prev\\");\\n```\\n\\nLast but not least - the new API allows you to restore focus to the last focused input \ud83e\udd2f. To achieve this, you should use:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { KeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\n// if keyboard is closed - it\'ll restore a focus\\n// if keyboard is open - it will not do anything\\nKeyboardController.setFocusTo(\\"current\\");\\n```\\n\\nSo, as you can see, for simple navigation to `next` and `previous` fields, you don\'t need to create a complex solutions with an array of `refs` in JS code - now it\'s powered by the new API of this library and allows you to delegate control to the library and simplify your codebase \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n## Instead of summary\\n\\nAs I roll out the `KeyboardToolbar`, I invite you to join me in this exciting journey. Elevate your app\'s user experience, redefine keyboard interaction, and watch as your users engage with your app in ways never imagined before. Stay tuned for more updates, and get ready to embrace the future of keyboard navigation.\\n\\nTo start to use this feature install the latest `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.11.0` and add this component into your app. \ud83d\ude0e Also don\'t forget to check [example](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller/tree/main/example) app to see how it\'s implemented there \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates.

This update brings two powerful new features to help you manage the keyboard behavior in your React Native applications. Whether you\'re building a simple form or a complex UI, these additions will make your life easier \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nimport Lottie from \\"lottie-react\\";\\nimport lottie from \\"../../docs/api/components/keyboard-sticky-view/ksv.lottie.json\\";\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \\"center\\", marginBottom: 20 }}>\\n  <Lottie\\n    className=\\"lottie\\"\\n    animationData={lottie}\\n    style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}\\n    loop\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### `KeyboardStickyView`\\n\\n`KeyboardStickyView` is a new component that simplifies handling keyboard interactions in your React Native applications. With this component, you can easily ensure that the content inside remains visible, accessible and is sticky to the keyboard movement. Here are some of the key features:\\n\\n- **Auto-Adjustment**: The `KeyboardStickyView` automatically adjusts the position of your UI components when the keyboard is displayed, ensuring that your content inside a container remains visible.\\n- **Customizable Behavior**: You have full control over how the UI adjusts when the keyboard is shown or hidden. You can specify `offset` property and it\'ll automatically interpolate values based on keyboard animation to make the transition seamless.\\n- **Universal Compatibility**: Whether your users are on Android or iOS, `KeyboardStickyView` ensures that your content remains accessible and visible, even when the keyboard appears. No more platform-specific quirks; it just works.\\n- **Custom Content**: The flexibility of `KeyboardStickyView` shines as you can place any content inside it. It\'s perfect for multi-step flows, chats, or any scenario where you need buttons and widgets to remain easily accessible when the keyboard is up.\\n- **Effortless Integration**: Implementing `KeyboardStickyView` in your app is a breeze. Just wrap your UI elements within this component, and it takes care of the rest. It automatically adjusts the position of your UI components as the keyboard is shown or hidden.\\n\\n### `useReanimatedFocusedInput` hook\\n\\nThis hook represents a significant evolution from the features introduced in the `1.6.0` release. In `1.6.0`, a new `target` property was introduced to fetch the layout of the currently focused `TextInput`. While it served its purpose, it came with a set of challenges:\\n\\n- **Complex Setup on Fabric Architecture**: Setting up this feature on the new Fabric architecture posed complications, including the use of deprecated APIs like `findNodeHandle`.\\n- **Inconsistencies Across Architectures**: The measurements could sometimes yield different results depending on the underlying architecture in use.\\n- **Inability to Detect Layout Changes**: It lacked the ability to detect layout changes for the focused `TextInput` within the library\'s ecosystem.\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, the decision was made to enhance the library\'s capabilities and introduce a new hook that simplifies interactions with the API while addressing the issues mentioned above. And thus, I present to you...\ud83e\udd41\\n\\nThe new `useReanimatedFocusedInput` hook \ud83d\ude0e. This hook eliminates the need for integrating or using third-party elements, ensuring consistent functionality across all platforms and architectures. Its standout feature is its ability to detect events crucial for building robust keyboard handling, even beyond direct keyboard interactions, such as the detection of layout changes.\\n\\nWith `useReanimatedFocusedInput`, I\'ve created a more streamlined and versatile solution to meet your needs.\\n\\n## Achieved milestones\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf89 Celebrating 1000 Stars: A Heartfelt Thank You to Our Incredible Community \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nThe `react-native-keyboard-controller` has reached an incredible milestone - **1000** stars! \ud83d\ude80 This achievement wouldn\'t have been possible without the unwavering support and contributions from amazing community of developers and enthusiasts.\\n\\nI want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who has been a part of this journey.

With this latest release, I introduce the `useKeyboardController` hook and `setEnabled` method, which allows for a gradual integration of the library into your project, enabling you to disable the module on specific screens as needed. This flexible feature ensures that your app\'s keyboard behavior remains seamless and user-friendly.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s New in Version 1.8.0: The `setEnabled` Hook\\n\\nThe star feature of `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.8.0` is the introduction of the `setEnabled` method. This method provides developers with granular control over when and where the library\'s keyboard management should be active.\\n\\n### How to Use `setEnabled`\\n\\nUsing the `setEnabled` method is incredibly straightforward. Here\'s a quick example of how to integrate it into your React Native project:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { useKeyboardController } from \\"react-native-keyboard-controller\\";\\n\\nconst { enabled, setEnabled } = useKeyboardController();\\n\\n// if you want to know whether is module active at the moment\\nconsole.log(enabled);\\n\\n// disable keyboard controller on a specific screen\\nsetEnabled(false);\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we\'re importing the `useKeyboardController` hook from the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library. This hook returns `setEnabled` method (which you can use to disable keyboard management for a specific screen) and `enabled` variable (indicating whether the module is active now or not).\\n\\nWhen you disable the module using `setEnabled(false)`, the screen will fallback to the default `Android` behavior, automatically resizing based on `AndroidManifest` preferences (`android:windowSoftInputMode`). This level of control allows you to tailor the keyboard experience to your app\'s unique needs on a per-screen basis.\\n\\n### Use Cases for `setEnabled`\\n\\nThe `setEnabled` method is incredibly versatile and can be employed in various scenarios:\\n\\n- **Forms**: Disable keyboard management on screens with simple forms that don\'t require custom keyboard management.\\n\\n- **Chat Interfaces**: Keep keyboard management enabled for chat screens, ensuring smooth and consistent user experiences during messaging interactions.\\n\\n- **Gradual Integration**: Tailor keyboard functionality on specific pages where you require precise control over how the keyboard behaves, while leaving other screens unaffected by these adjustments.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n`react-native-keyboard-controller` continues to evolve, making it an essential tool for React Native developers who want to provide exceptional user experiences in their mobile apps.\\n\\nWith the introduction of the `setEnabled` method in version `1.8.0`, you now have even more control over keyboard behavior, ensuring that your app feels polished and responsive \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nTo get started with the latest version, check out the [official documentation](../) and explore the new possibilities that the `setEnabled` method offers.\\n\\nUpgrade your React Native project today and take your keyboard management to the next level with `react-native-keyboard-controller` version `1.8.0`!\\n\\nStay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library.

It\'s especially important when you want your app to look and feel polished on both `iOS` and `Android` devices. While the built-in `KeyboardAvoidingView` component in React Native works well for `iOS`, it doesn\'t provide the same level of smoothness and consistency on `Android`.\\n\\nI have been hard at work, and in this upcoming release, I\'m thrilled to unveil the enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`. With this component, you can achieve a seamless keyboard animation experience across both major platforms \u2013 `iOS` and `Android`.\\n\\n## Features of `KeyboardAvoidingView`\\n\\n### Platform-agnostic Animation\\n\\nWith the new `KeyboardAvoidingView`, you can say goodbye to platform-specific workarounds. This component is designed to work harmoniously on both `iOS` and `Android`, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout your app.\\n\\n### Smoother Animations\\n\\nThe enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView` offers smoother and more natural animations when the keyboard appears or disappears. This means your UI elements will gracefully adjust to accommodate the keyboard, preventing awkward overlaps and ensuring your users can interact with your app seamlessly.\\n\\n### Backward Compatible and Seamless Integration\\n\\nI understand the importance of maintaining compatibility with existing code bases and providing a smooth transition for React Native developers. With enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I\'ve put compatibility at the forefront of design principles.\\n\\nThe `KeyboardAvoidingView` is crafted to seamlessly integrate with your existing React Native projects. It\'s a **drop-in** replacement for the default React Native `KeyboardAvoidingView` component. This means that you can start using an enhanced version without the need for extensive code modifications or rewrites.\\n\\nWhether you\'re working on a brand-new project or updating an existing app, making the switch to re-implemented `KeyboardAvoidingView` is as simple as updating your import statements. Your existing codebase remains intact, and the benefits of smoother animations and cross-platform compatibility come without the hassle \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n### Customizable\\n\\nI believe that the best tools are those that adapt to your unique project requirements. That\'s why I\'m excited to introduce a dedicated avenue for customization. If you find that the default behavior of `KeyboardAvoidingView` doesn\'t precisely align with your app\'s needs, I encourage you to explore the possibilities of customization \ud83e\udd13\\n\\n#### Share Your Ideas and Report Bugs \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nYour feedback is invaluable to me. If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or you encounter any issues while using `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I invite you to get involved. Feel free to submit your suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports through my [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller) repository.\\n\\nThe community is built on collaboration, and together, I believe we can make this library even better. By actively participating and sharing your insights, you contribute to the growth and enhancement of `react-native-keyboard-controller` and `KeyboardAvoidingView` in a particular.\\n\\n## What\'s Coming Next\\n\\nWhile I\'m excited to introduce the `KeyboardAvoidingView` in this release, my commitment to making your React Native development experience smoother doesn\'t stop here. I have big plans to expand the library with more pre-built components designed to simplify complex tasks related to keyboard handling.\\n\\nIn the pipeline, you can look forward to components like `KeyboardAwareScrollView` for effortlessly managing scroll views, `StickyFooter` for keeping crucial UI elements in view, and much more. My goal is to provide you with a comprehensive toolkit for creating exceptional user interfaces in React Native.\\n\\nStay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library.

Now, you can precisely calculate the delay between an event occurring in the native thread and its propagation to JavaScript. This level of accuracy enables you to orchestrate keyboard handling with finesse, ensuring a seamless and visually pleasing user experience.\\n\\n### Target: Layout mastery at your fingertips\\n\\nUnlock the potential of enhanced layout handling with the `target` field in event metadata. By accessing the view tag of the focused field, you can synchronously retrieve layout information. This newfound capability empowers you to make real-time adjustments to your UI elements based on the active input, creating a fluid and context-aware user interface.\\n\\n### Duration: Elevate animation fluidity\\n\\nExperience the art of animation depth with the `duration` field in event metadata. If you\'re aiming for parallax-like effects without the intricacies of frame-in-frame keyboard animations, this feature is your key! Define the `duration` of the keyboard animation to achieve a captivating parallax effect that adds a touch of elegance to your app\'s visual appeal.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nI\'m also excited to share a sneak peek into what\'s on the horizon \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nDuring the `1.6.0` development cycle, I\'ve delved even deeper into keyboard handling, uncovering insights that will shape the way you interact with keyboards in your React Native apps. So my investigation has inspired a new API that will make keyboard interactions more intuitive and seamless. Whether you\'re a seasoned developer or just starting out, managing keyboards will become a breeze.\\n\\nAlso I will be actively addressing GitHub issues and ensuring compatibility with the latest React Native version. My commitment to excellence means you can rely on a stable and up-to-date library \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) for updates.
