I'm glad to announce the upcoming release of `react-native-keyboard-controller`, a library designed to enhance your React Native app's user experience. This release marks a significant milestone as I introduce a powerful new feature: the `KeyboardAvoidingView`. But that's not all – I have exciting plans to expand the collection of pre-built components to simplify handling keyboard insets even further.
