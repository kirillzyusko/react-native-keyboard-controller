I'm glad to announce the upcoming release of `react-native-keyboard-controller`, a library designed to enhance your React Native app's user experience. This release marks a significant milestone as I introduce a powerful new feature: the `KeyboardAvoidingView`. But that's not all – I have exciting plans to expand the collection of pre-built components to simplify handling keyboard insets even further.

One of the common challenges React Native developers face is handling the keyboard's appearance and disappearance gracefully. It's especially important when you want your app to look and feel polished on both `iOS` and `Android` devices. While the built-in `KeyboardAvoidingView` component in React Native works well for `iOS`, it doesn't provide the same level of smoothness and consistency on `Android`.

I have been hard at work, and in this upcoming release, I'm thrilled to unveil the enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`. With this component, you can achieve a seamless keyboard animation experience across both major platforms – `iOS` and `Android`.

## Features of `KeyboardAvoidingView`[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#features-of-keyboardavoidingview "Direct link to features-of-keyboardavoidingview")

### Platform-agnostic Animation[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#platform-agnostic-animation "Direct link to Platform-agnostic Animation")

With the new `KeyboardAvoidingView`, you can say goodbye to platform-specific workarounds. This component is designed to work harmoniously on both `iOS` and `Android`, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout your app.

### Smoother Animations[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#smoother-animations "Direct link to Smoother Animations")

The enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView` offers smoother and more natural animations when the keyboard appears or disappears. This means your UI elements will gracefully adjust to accommodate the keyboard, preventing awkward overlaps and ensuring your users can interact with your app seamlessly.

### Backward Compatible and Seamless Integration[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#backward-compatible-and-seamless-integration "Direct link to Backward Compatible and Seamless Integration")

I understand the importance of maintaining compatibility with existing code bases and providing a smooth transition for React Native developers. With enhanced `KeyboardAvoidingView`, I've put compatibility at the forefront of design principles.

The `KeyboardAvoidingView` is crafted to seamlessly integrate with your existing React Native projects. It's a **drop-in** replacement for the default React Native `KeyboardAvoidingView` component. This means that you can start using an enhanced version without the need for extensive code modifications or rewrites.

Whether you're working on a brand-new project or updating an existing app, making the switch to re-implemented `KeyboardAvoidingView` is as simple as updating your import statements. Your existing codebase remains intact, and the benefits of smoother animations and cross-platform compatibility come without the hassle 😎

### Customizable[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#customizable "Direct link to Customizable")

I believe that the best tools are those that adapt to your unique project requirements. That's why I'm excited to introduce a dedicated avenue for customization. If you find that the default behavior of `KeyboardAvoidingView` doesn't precisely align with your app's needs, I encourage you to explore the possibilities of customization 🤓

#### Share Your Ideas and Report Bugs 💡[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#share-your-ideas-and-report-bugs- "Direct link to Share Your Ideas and Report Bugs 💡")

Feel free to submit your suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports through my [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller) repository.

The community is built on collaboration, and together, I believe we can make this library even better. By actively participating and sharing your insights, you contribute to the growth and enhancement of `react-native-keyboard-controller` and `KeyboardAvoidingView` in a particular.

## What's Coming Next[​](/react-native-keyboard-controller/blog/components.md#whats-coming-next "Direct link to What's Coming Next")

While I'm excited to introduce the `KeyboardAvoidingView` in this release, my commitment to making your React Native development experience smoother doesn't stop here. I have big plans to expand the library with more pre-built components designed to simplify complex tasks related to keyboard handling.

In the pipeline, you can look forward to components like `KeyboardAwareScrollView` for effortlessly managing scroll views, `StickyFooter` for keeping crucial UI elements in view, and much more. My goal is to provide you with a comprehensive toolkit for creating exceptional user interfaces in React Native.

Stay tuned for future updates and releases as I continue to enhance the `react-native-keyboard-controller` library. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ziusko) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for updates. Thank you for your support! 😊
