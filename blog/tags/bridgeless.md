I'm excited to announce the latest release, version 1.12.0, of react-native-keyboard-controller!

Although this release may not seem monumental, it's significant, and I'm thrilled to share it with you. 😍

The key features of this release are: **bridgeless** support, selection tracking, enhanced `KeyboardToolbar` component and synchronous `onMove` handler on iOS among other bug fixes and improvements.
