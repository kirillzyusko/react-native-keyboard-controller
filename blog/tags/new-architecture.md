I'm glad to announce, that new upcoming release `1.2.0` brings a support for new react native architecture ðŸ˜Ž

Fortunately this library is backward compatible with old architecture and will be compiled conditionally depending on which architecture you are using. So don't be afraid of updating it to the latest version - it doesn't have any breaking changes!
