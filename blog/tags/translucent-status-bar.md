This update brings significant improvements and new features to enhance the way your React Native apps handle keyboard interactions. With better support for `Modal` components, dynamic `StatusBar` translucency, and new customization options for `KeyboardGestureArea`s, this release is designed to make your development process smoother and your app's user experience more seamless. ðŸš€
