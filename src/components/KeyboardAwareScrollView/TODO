- [x] focus large input -> scroll till the end
- [x] top part is not visible + change selection coordinates (don't interfere with keyboard frame) -> scroll gets triggered -- `if (point < 0) {`
- [x] paste five empty lines doesn't perform scroll
- [ ] new e2e test to cover full screen input scenario
