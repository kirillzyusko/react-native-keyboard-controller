Below you can see a short overview of library API:

```js

  KeyboardProvider,
  useKeyboardAnimation,
} from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';

// 1. wrap your app in Provider
<KeyboardProvider>
  <AppContainer />
</KeyboardProvider>

// 2. get animation values where you need them
const { height, progress } = useKeyboardAnimation();

// 3. Animate any elements as you wish :)
<Animated.View
  style={{
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    borderRadius: 25,
    // the element will move up with the keyboard
    transform: [{ translateY: height }],
  }}
/>
<Animated.View
  style={{
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: 'green',
    borderRadius: 25,
    transform: [
      {
        // or use custom interpolation using `progress`
        translateX: progress.interpolate({
          inputRange: [0, 1],
          outputRange: [0, 100],
        }),
